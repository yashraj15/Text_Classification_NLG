new  yob  targets to be unveiled fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in england and wales will be named on thursday.  ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. a year ago  ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and thursday s figures offer a progress check. they will say that in the past year more than 2 600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.  police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders  breaking up groups of youths in public places. the 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. exeter and cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.  prime minister tony blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of asbos and fixed penalty notices. there are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.  he is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed.  we have not defeated this problem by any means  but shown together what can be done   he will say. mr blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws  saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.  ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25 000 community support officers (csos). but researchers from leeds university warned that csos could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. more work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before csos  they argued in a the study. critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. home office minister hazel blears also revealed this week that  about a third  of asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.

ireland win eclipses refereeing  errors  the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up.  it may have to go the whole way and have nfl-style video cameras all over the field  or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles. what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. sunday s explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948. the game was as exciting as it comes  with a much-improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. one can understand that frustration. there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory  but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport s  blazers . referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece. i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made. after all  he has no public recourse to criticism.  it was the same for simon mcdowell  the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france. as far as england were concerned  there were queries over mark cueto s first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick.  england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup. on that occasion  david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe  who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end.  lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. however  one has to credit ireland flanker johnny o connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. but in rugby  everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes. the referee also missed england s danny grewcock taking out ronan o gara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line. those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes.  but there were many more  and one should not take away from those. brian o driscoll s winning try was as well-conceived as they come  while charlie hodgson s brilliant kicking display was another highlight. and ronan o gara s tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes. two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on. the first was denis hickie s brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross-field kick  then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try. ireland s second-row colossus paul o connell was equally superb. england had turned ireland one way then the other  and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. unfortunately he ran into o connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. that spoke volumes about ireland s back-foot display  with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end. to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward. it may be tries that win games  but it is defence that wins championships.
moving mobile improves golf swing a mobile phone that recognises and responds to movements has been launched in japan.  the motion-sensitive phone - officially titled the v603sh - was developed by sharp and launched by vodafone s japanese division. devised mainly for mobile gaming  users can also access other phone functions using a pre-set pattern of arm movements. the phone will allow golf fans to improve their swing via a golfing game.  those who prefer shoot- em-ups will be able to use the phone like a gun to shoot the zombies in the mobile version of sega s house of the dead. the phone comes with a tiny motion-control sensor  a computer chip that responds to movement.  other features include a display screen that allows users to watch tv and can rotate 180 degrees. it also doubles up as an electronic musical instrument. users have to select a sound from a menu that includes clapping  tambourine and maracas and shake their phone to create a beat. it is being recommended for the karaoke market. the phone will initially be available in japan only and is due to go on sale in mid-february. the new gadget could make for interesting people-watching among japanese commuters  who are able to access their mobiles on the subway. fishing afficiandos in south korea are already using a phone that allows them to simulate the movement of a rod. the ph-s6500 phone  dubbed a sports-leisure gadget  was developed by korean phone giant pantech and can also be used by runners to measure calorie consumption and distance run.
blair  pressing us on climate  tony blair is pressing the us to cut greenhouse gases despite its unwillingness to sign the kyoto protocol  downing street has indicated.  officials have confirmed climate change was discussed when influential senator john mccain recently visited mr blair. climate change was an issue the prime minister  wanted to progress  during the uk s presidency of the g8 and eu in 2005  said a spokesman. but he played down reports mr blair was considering a new us-friendly treaty.  according to the times  the uk leader wants to end us isolation with a  kyoto-lite  agreement on the scale and nature of the threat from climate change. he is said to have discussed the idea with mr mccain during his time at number 10. the prime minister is said to believe the united states  refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on emissions is undermining other countries  resolve to cut carbon dioxide production. so far the us has refused to sign up to the kyoto treaty - which aims to cut emissions - branding it politically motivated and not based on science. president bush s advisers have repeatedly denied global warming is taking place.  europe  which disputes the claim  has also signalled it wants to press ahead with talks about longer term climate change action in a way which involves both the united states and developing countries. mr blair s reported treaty would also establish an international programme to develop technology needed for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions  says the times. but there is still apparently  little prospect  of america agreeing to cut emissions  which could further provoke environmental campaigners already angry at the lack of progress. mr blair was left blushing on wednesday when it emerged his manifesto target of a 20% cut to the 1990 greenhouse gas level by 2010 was set to be missed.
robben and cole earn chelsea win cheslea salvaged a win against a battling portsmouth side just as it looked like the premiership leaders would have to settle for a point.  arjen robben curled in a late deflected left-footed shot from the right side of pompey s box to break the home side s brave resistance. chelsea had been continually frustrated but joe cole added a second with a 20-yard shot in injury-time. nigel quashie had pompey s best chance when his effort was tipped over. the fratton park crowd were in good voice as usual and  even though portsmouth more than held their own  chelsea still managed to carve out two early chances. striker didier drogba snapped in an angled shot to force home keeper shaka hislop into a smart save while an unmarked frank lampard had a strike blocked by arjan de zeeuw. but pompey chased  harried and unsettled a chelsea side as the south-coast side started to gain the upper hand and almost took the lead through quashie.  the midfielder struck a swerving long range shot which keeper petr cech tipped over at full stretch. pompey stretched arsenal to the limit recently and were providing a similarly tough obstacle to overcome for a chelsea team struggling to exert any pressure. velimir zajec s players stood firm as the visitors came out in lively fashion after the break but  just as they took a stranglehold of the match  the visitors launched a counter-attack. drogba spun to get a sight of goal and struck a fierce shot which rocked keeper hislop back as he blocked before arjan de zeeuw cleared the danger.  the home side were also left breathing a sigh of relief when a glen johnson header fell to gudjohnsen who had his back to goal in a crowded pompey goalmouth. the icelandic forward tried to acrobatically direct the ball into goal but put his effort over. but  just like against arsenal  portsmouth let in a late goal when robben s shot took a deflection off matthew taylor on its way past a wrong-footed hislop. and cole put a bit of gloss on a hard-fought win when he put a low shot into the bottom of the pompey net.  hislop  griffin  primus  de zeeuw  taylor  stone (cisse 76)  quashie (berkovic 83)  faye  o neil  kamara (fuller 65)  yakubu.  subs not used: berger  ashdown.  kamara.  cech  paulo ferreira  gallas  terry  johnson  duff  makelele  smertin (cole 73)  lampard  robben (geremi 81)  drogba (gudjohnsen 58).  subs not used: cudicini  bridge.  paulo ferreira  robben  lampard.  robben 79  cole 90.  20 210  a wiley (staffordshire).
fear will help france - laporte france coach bernard laporte believes his team will be scared going into their game with england on sunday  but claims it will work in their favour.  the french turned in a stuttering performance as they limped to a 16-9 win against scotland in the opening match of the six nations on saturday.  we will go to twickenham with a little fear and it ll give us a boost   said the french coach. he added:  we are never good enough when we are favourites.  meanwhile  perpignan centre jean-philippe granclaude is delighted to have received his first call-up to the france squad.  it s incredible   the youngster said.  i was not expecting it at all.  playing with the france team has always been a dream and now it has come true and i am about to face england at twickenham in the six nations.  laporte will announce his starting line-up on wednesday at the french team s training centre in marcoussis  near paris.
smart search lets art fans browse if you don t know art but know what you like  new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting.  artgarden  developed by bt s research unit  is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings. rather than search by the name of an artist or painting  users are shown a selection of pictures. clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works.  the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity  which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. it  chooses  a selection of pictures  by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them. so  for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement  19th century and water. a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user  based partly on the keywords and partly on luck.  it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery   said jemima rellie  head of the tate s digital programme. for richard tateson  who worked on the artgarden project  the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration.  i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i didn t have a clue what i wanted   he said. the text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer  neither of which he found helpful. he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead.  he thinks the dominance of text-based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers. similarly  with art  browsing is often more important than finding a particular object.  you don t arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see. one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn t have asked for   he said. the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that  said ms rellie. she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future. bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching  such as for music and films.
uk s national gallery in the pink the national gallery  home to some of the uk s greatest artworks  has seen a big jump in visitor numbers.  five million visitors made the london gallery - which houses treasures like raphael s madonna of the pinks - the uk s most visited museum in 2004. it recorded a 13.8% rise in numbers and was the country s second most visited tourist attraction  behind blackpool pleasure beach. charles saumarez smith  the gallery s director  said he was  delighted . he said the number of visitors through the doors had boosted figures to pre-11 september 2001 levels. mr saumarez smith added that the pedestrianisation of trafalgar square  where the gallery is located  and strong temporary collections throughout 2004 had led to the strong performance.   our 2004 exhibition programme of el greco  russian landscape in the age of tolstoy and raphael: from urbino to rome was particularly strong and exceeded all targets   he said.  the exceptional quality of the paintings in our permanent collection is also huge draw for the public.  the expectations of today s visitors are higher than ever and we have kept pace with their demands.  mr saumarez smith said he was confident the gallery could maintain the attendance.  with important exhibitions of the work of caravaggio  stubbs and rubens in place for 2005  i am confident that the gallery is set for another highly successful year   he added. the figures were prepared by the association of leading visitor attractions (alva).  it found that the figures had been boosted by an increase in europeans travelling to the uk on budget airlines. popular cultural tourist spots such as the tate modern and the natural history museum all recorded increases of more than 10% in visitor numbers compared with 2003. but for legal or confidentiality reasons some alva members did not submit figures for 2004  including buckingham palace  windsor castle  madame tussauds and alton towers. alva director robin broke said:  visits from western europe were up by 10% and from north america by some 9% compared to 2003  while numbers from the rest of the world rose 20%.  european figures were helped by the rapid growth of low-cost flights to britain from europe  especially from new eu countries.
film production  falls  40% in uk the number of british films produced in the uk fell 40% in 2004  with movies starring johnny depp and jude law among those affected  screen daily has said.  twenty-seven british films were made in the uk last year following a drop in funding  compared with 45 in 2003  according to the trade weekly. it attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the national lottery. uk and us co-productions in britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year.  last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the uk. several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown  coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and miramax films. shooting on period drama tulip fever  which was to star jude law and keira knightley  was postponed indefinitely while shooting of the libertine starring johnny depp was moved to the isle of man.   there isn t anything coming in to replace (the funds)   said the libertine s executive producer marc samuelson.  we are in a hiatus.  films with  medium  budgets of up to £9m  a similar level to box office hits vera drake  calendar girls and enduring love  are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. the strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of us films shot in the uk during 2004  screen international added. big budget co-productions  such as the harry potter series  continued to be shot in the uk  however. the uk film council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for british film production  when bridget jones: the edge of reason  wimbledon and thunderbirds were all filmed in the uk.   the drop was expected as there was no way 2003 s record level of production could be bettered   the council s spokesperson said.  the reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors  including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.  it was  too early  to predict whether the downward trend in uk production would continue throughout 2005  the uk film council said. in september the government introduced subsidies worth up to £4m per film for medium budget films  under new treasury measures. it is also due to announce a replacement for uk film tax relief scheme section 48 in july.
henman decides to quit davis cup tim henman has retired from great britain s davis cup team.  the 30-year-old  who made his davis cup debut in 1994  is now set to fully focus on the atp tour and on winning his first grand slam event.  i ve made no secret of the fact that representing great britain has always been a top priority for me throughout my career   henman told his website. captain jeremy bates has touted alex bogdanovic and andrew murray as possible replacements for the veteran. henman added that he was available to help britain in its bid for davis cup success  with the next tie against israel in march .  although i won t be playing  i would still like to make myself available to both jeremy and the lta in the future so that i can draw upon my experience in the hope of trying to help the british players develop their full potential   he added.  i ve really enjoyed playing in front of the thousands of british fans both home and abroad and would like to thank every one of them for their unwavering support over the years.  henman leaves davis cup tennis with an impressive record  having won 36 of his 50 matches. great britain captain jeremy bates paid tribute to henman s efforts over the years.   tim has quite simply had a phenomenal davis cup career and it has been an absolute privilege to have captained the team with him in it   said bates.  tim s magnificent record speaks for itself. while it s a great loss i completely understand and respect his decision to retire from davis cup and focus on the grand slams and tour.    looking to the future this decision obviously marks a watershed in british davis cup tennis but it is also a huge opportunity for the next generation to make their mark.  we have a host of talented players coming through and despite losing someone of tim s calibre  i remain very optimistic about the future.  henman made his davis cup debut in 1994 against romania in manchester. he and partner bates won their doubles rubber on the middle saturday of the tie. britain eventually lost the contest 3-2. henman and britain had little luck in davis cup matches until 1999 when they qualified for the world group. britain drew the usa and lost the tie when greg rusedski fell to jim courier in the deciding rubber. they made the final stages again  in 2002  but this time lost out to the might of sweden.

uk net users leading tv downloads british tv viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading us shows from the net  according to research.  new episodes of 24  desperate housewives and six feet under  appear on the web hours after they are shown in the us  said a report. web tracking company envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the uk and that downloads of tv programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. about 70% were using file-sharing program bittorrent  the firm said.  it s now as easy to download a pirate tv show as it is to programme a vcr   said ben coppin from envisional. a typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100 000 people globally  said the report  and an estimated 20 000 of those were from within the uk.  fans of many popular us tv programmes  like 24  usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the uk. but in some cases  said the report  people were able to watch the new episodes in britain before us audiences on the west coast of the country.  missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet   explained mr coppin.   two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. in effect  the internet is now a global video recorder.  exact figures are difficult to pin down  but it is thought that about 80 000 to 100 000 people in the uk download tv programmes. some may just want the odd episode  others are downloading regularly. many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content  like tv programmes. this presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. it is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. the industry has coined the term  time-shifting  to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want  when you want. the increased popularity of personal digital video recorders  tivo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like sky+  have also contributed to the trend. there are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store tv programmes for viewers  effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.  within half an hour  recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. because they tend to be shorter then full-length films  they can be processed - digitised - quickly. more people with high-speed broadband connections in the uk also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.  according to jupiter research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. the envisional reports said that the tv industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. the bbc ran a trial of what it calls the interactive media player (imp) last year  which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. it let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. it is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. the bbc already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. about six million people in the uk now have a fast  always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.
adriano s chelsea link rejected adriano s agent gilmar rinaldi has insisted that he has had no contact with chelsea over the striker.  chelsea were reported to have made inquiries about inter milan s 22-year-old brazilian star. rinaldi told bbc sport from rio de janeiro:  i can assure you that chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or adriano.  parma and real madrid are interested but there s nothing new there. their interest has been known for some time.  adriano has scored 14 goals in 20 serie a appearances this season. and chelsea boss jose mourinho had claimed that he was in milan talking to adriano on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with arsenal defender ashley cole. mourinho said he was  just practising my portuguese with him because i don t need strikers . rinaldi told bbc sport:  i have to say that nobody from chelsea or any other london club has contacted me.  if they want to  that s fine. i can tell them what the situation is.  if chelsea are interested then they must make an offer.  inter are reported to have slapped a price tag in the region of £40m on the head of adriano  who joined them just over a year ago from parma. real madrid view him as a natural replacement for compatriot ronaldo. but rinaldi said:  i cannot give you a price that inter would accept for adriano. that s something that would have to be negotiated between the interested clubs.
video phone help for deaf people deaf people who prefer to communicate using british sign language (bsl) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.  the video relay service is being piloted by the royal national institute for deaf people (rnid)  but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people s pockets. the rnid is urging telecoms regulator  ofcom  to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. the service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a bsl interpreter via a webcam or video phone  and the interpreter then relays the deaf person s conversation using a telephone and translates the other person s response into sign language.  for many deaf people  especially those born deaf  bsl is a first and preferred means of communication.  until now  the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator.  in the past  i ve used textphones but they have problems   said robert currington who is taking part in the pilot.  i communicate in bsl; my written english is not very good and it takes me longer to think in english and type my message.   i sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.  the rnid says the uk is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call.  there are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people   said rnid technology director  guido gybels.  in the us and australia  sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call.  by failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users  the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.   ofcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. and new technology  including the video relay service  will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. but a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation.  any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider   he said. mr currington  like many of the uk s 70 000 bsl users  will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available.  the relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure   he said.  i can show my emotions more easily in bsl in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.
ocean s twelve raids box office ocean s twelve  the crime caper sequel starring george clooney  brad pitt and julia roberts  has gone straight to number one in the us box office chart.  it took $40.8m (£21m) in weekend ticket sales  according to studio estimates. the sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across europe. it knocked last week s number one  national treasure  into third place. wesley snipes  blade: trinity was in second  taking $16.1m (£8.4m). rounding out the top five was animated fable the polar express  starring tom hanks  and festive comedy christmas with the kranks.  ocean s twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a december release in the us  after the three films in the lord of the rings trilogy. the sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor  ocean s eleven which took $38.1m (£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (£95.8m) in total. a remake of the 1960s film  starring frank sinatra and the rat pack  ocean s eleven was directed by oscar-winning director steven soderbergh. soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites clooney  pitt and roberts with matt damon  andy garcia and elliott gould. catherine zeta-jones joins the all-star cast.  it s just a fun  good holiday movie   said dan fellman  president of distribution at warner bros. however  us critics were less complimentary about the $110m (£57.2m) project  with the los angeles times labelling it a  dispiriting vanity project . a milder review in the new york times dubbed the sequel  unabashedly trivial .
takeover rumour lifts exel shares shares in storage and delivery firm exel closed up 9% at a two-and-a-half year high on tuesday on speculation it is to receive an imminent takeover bid.  the talk in the city is that us giant united parcel services (ups) is the most likely bidder for the firm. yet other names mentioned in connection to buying exel are dhl-owner deutsche post and finance firm ge capital. with its shares closing tuesday at 873p  bracknell-based exel is currently valued at £2.6bn ($6.3bn).  exel employs 109 000 people in more than 120 countries and has itself been active in the consolidation of the logistics sector  paying £328m to buy fellow uk firm tibbett & britten last august. its customers include boots  burberry  mothercare and consumer products giant procter & gamble. andrew beh  of brokers ing  said ups and deutsche post were the most likely bidders and an offer of 950p a share would be fair if a bidding battle did not break out.  it s a great strategic fit for both companies   he said.  both are interested in expanding in logistics and you can make a decent case for cost synergies which could justify the premium and that s before you make any argument about revenue synergies.
ferguson fears milan cutting edge manchester united manager sir alex ferguson said his side s task against ac milan would not be made any easier by the absence of andriy shevchenko.  milan s talismanic european footballer of the year misses wednesday s champions league first-leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone.  it s a loss (to milan)  but it could be worse if they didn t have such quality to bring in   ferguson said.  how much they miss him i think they ll know tomorrow night.  ferguson said milan s front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders.  they can play rui costa and play kaka forward. they can bring serginho in and they can play (jon dahl) tomasson   he said. ferguson s own goalscoring talisman ruud van nistelrooy is fit again  but the scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the dutchman  who has not played for three months.   ruud is the best striker in europe. what i have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long   he said.  his ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision.  ferguson  though  is confident his young players  particularly wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo  are up to the task.  we have an opportunity to win this cup this year  no question about that   he declared.  with the maturity we see every week in ronaldo and rooney  the return of van nistelrooy and the form of roy keane  paul scholes and ryan giggs  we must have a fantastic chance.  it is a view shared by rooney  who believes  if we can get past milan  we have a great chance .  as soon as i knew we were playing milan  i got excited. looking at the draw  it is anyone s trophy but we have every chance.  hopefully  we can get to that final in turkey and bring the cup back to manchester.  milan coach carlo ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted europe s most prestigious club title two seasons ago. milan beat juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at old trafford and ancelotti said:  we are all very happy to return (to old trafford) to play in the champions league and this will give us great motivation.  ancelotti said he was aware of the threat united posed to his hopes of champions league glory.  it s fundamental that we don t allow them to take control of the game. our intention is not to adapt to their play but to play our game   he said.  they have great quality in attack  they use the wings a lot and we will have to make sure we stop them.
domain system scam fear a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers  a trade body has warned.  the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet electronic task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.  registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers  says stephen dyer  director of ukif. domain names are the  real language  addresses of websites  rather than their internet protocol address  which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so  for example  website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian  a  look just like an english  a . but the computer code would be different  and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system  said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent  mr dyer said.  although the idn problem is well known in technical circles  the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked   said mr dyer.   it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site   he added. there are solutions. for instance  browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world s browsers. another solution  to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of  throwing out the baby with the bath water   he said. centr  the council of european national top level domain registries  agrees.  a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world   the organisation said in a statement.
aaliyah claim dismissed by court late r&b star aaliyah s record company has failed in an attempt to sue the video producer who booked the ill-fated flight on which she died in 2001.  a new york appeals court has told blackground records that only the singer s parents had the right to launch a claim for wrongful death. the 22-year-old singer s family came to an undisclosed settlement over a negligence claim in 2003. aaliyah had completed a music video when the plane crashed in the bahamas. she and eight others were killed on the plane  which crashed as if left for florida. blackground records  lawyer frank penski said he had yet to examine the decision and did not know whether they would pursue the case.  an investigation into the crash revealed the twin-engined cessna was overloaded by 700 pounds (320kg). a post-mortem carried out on the remains of the pilot showed there was cocaine and alcohol in his body. aaliyah was a rising star in music and film before she was killed. she was honoured with a string of posthumous awards and her single more than a woman went to number one in the uk.
nintendo handheld given euro date nintendo s new handheld console  the ds  will launch in europe on 11 march  the company has announced.  the portable games machine  which features touch-screen control  will retail for £99 in the uk (149 euros). nintendo said 15 games would be available in the uk at launch  with prices ranging from £19 to £29. more than 2.8 million ds consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the us and japan at the end of 2004. rival sony has said it will launch its first handheld console  the psp  in the us and europe before the end of march. the psp is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market  despite sony s assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers.  the 15 games available on the european launch date will include nintendo s super mario 64 ds  as well as titles from third-party developers such as ubisoft s rayman ds.  more than 120 games are in development for the new console  nintendo has said. the ds is backwards compatible with the game boy advance  allowing the earlier machine s back catalogue of 700 games to be played. additionally  a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the ds  with a  download play  option which allows a group to play against each other  even if just one person owns a copy. other features include a short-range messaging application called pictochat  and a built-in microphone which is used in sega s launch title project rub. nintendo has also announced a media adapter  which will allow the console to play music and video on the move.  the launch price of £99 (149 euros) compares favourably with the us price of $149  according to john houlihan  editor of the computerandvideogames.com magazine.  it s a very  very competitive price point. there are some innovative features  and nintendo has created quite a buzz   he says.  however  the line-up of games could have been stronger. everyone wanted to see the eight-player mario kart ds  for example.   mr houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the nintendo ds and sony s new psp  with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device.  the psp is a sexy bit of kit  but sony s attitude to the psp has been very understated in europe  so far   mr houlihan said. the worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004  according to industry analysts screen digest.  in the past  games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in europe than in other parts of the world. however nintendo president satoru iwata said the company was  pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the us and european launch .  europe is an extremely important market for nintendo   mr iwata added. nintendo raised its sales targets for the ds console last december after selling a million in the us and japan in just a few weeks.
souness eyes summer move for owen newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up a summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen.  he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer  who is due to retire in the summer  although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on.  michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and we re monitoring him   he told bbc newcastle.  he is a great centre-forward and only 25 but i don t think we re the only ones monitoring the situation at real.  souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season. he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburn s club scoring record may influence the striker s decision.  milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957  while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name.  without giving too much away  i am confident he will be here next season   said souness.  i can t imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburn s scoring record.  souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window. the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the phone-in for bbc newcastle  souness said tried to re-sign him  but villa were not interested in selling.  the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed.  i m after three  four or five new players in the summer - we have got lots of targets   he said.  don t think we will wait to the last day of the season to say: `who are we going to target now
bush to get  tough  on deficit us president george w bush has pledged to introduce a  tough  federal budget next february in a bid to halve the country s deficit in five years.  the us budget and its trade deficit are both deep in the red  helping to push the dollar to lows against the euro and fuelling fears about the economy. mr bush indicated there would be  strict discipline  on non-defence spending in the budget. the vow to cut the deficit had been one of his re-election declarations. the federal budget deficit hit a record $412bn (£211.6bn) in the 12 months to 30 september and $377bn in the previous year.   we will submit a budget that fits the times   mr bush said.  it will provide every tool and resource to the military  will protect the homeland  and meet other priorities of the government.  the us has said it is committed to a strong dollar. but the dollar s weakness has hit european and asian exporters and lead to calls for us intervention to boost the currency. mr bush  however  has said the best way to halt the dollar s slide is to deal with the us deficit.  it s a budget that i think will send the right signal to the financial markets and to those concerned about our short-term deficits   mr bush added.  as well  we ve got to deal with the long-term deficit issues.
ask jeeves joins web log market ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.  the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read  search and share all the blogs they are interested in. ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed.  bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication (rss) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. google acquired pyra labs  makers of the blogger software  in 2003. in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. jim lanzone  vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us  said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.   the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers   he said. mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask s my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.  search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites   he said. it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates. there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines  said mr lanzone.  our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away   he said. though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology.  being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right   said mr lanzone. rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders.

o connell rejects lions rumours ireland and munster lock paul o connell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the lions tour to new zealand this summer.  o connell is rumoured to be among the front-runners for the job  but says he is totally focused on sunday s six nations crunch clash with england.  i honestly don t think about these reports   he told bbc sport.  the lions thing is all speculation and newspaper talk  nothing more. i just ignore it and get on with my job.  he added:  the only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think.  i can just imagine them saying  i m going to show this guy what s what about second row play . that s the one thing that makes me cringe.  o connell  who made a try-scoring international debut against wales two years ago  is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugby s shop window - but refuses to be drawn on the lions.   i have spoken to sir clive woodward a few times  but not for very long  certainly nothing about summer holidays   he joked. he also said he remains wary of wounded england s abilities coming into sunday s game after two straight defeats  dismissing predictions of a certain irish victory.  it s very dangerous to think that. this england team has so much experience and skill. you do not become a bad team overnight.  they have two world class game-breakers in josh lewsey and jason robinson  while charlie hodgson is just ready to click into place.  he insisted ireland will not make the mistake of being over-confident.  that s not going to happen in our squad. no ireland team lining up to play england will ever fall into that trap   he said.  every time we play england we know what a big task it is. look at what they did to us two years ago. i remember that game all too well  and it was not a good feeling.  i came on as a replacement and we were losing 13-6  and ended up getting hammered 42-6  so i know what can happen when england come to dublin.  they could so easily have been coming to dublin with two wins and staring a grand slam in the face as well.
hodgson shoulders england blame fly-half charlie hodgson admitted his wayward kicking played a big part in england s 18-17 defeat to france.  hodgson failed to convert three penalties and also missed a relatively easy drop goal attempt which would have given england a late win.  i m very disappointed with the result and with my myself   hodgson said.  it is very hard to take but it s something i will have to get through and come back stronger. my training s been good but it just didn t happen.  hodgson revealed that olly barkley had taken three penalties because they were  out of my range  but the centre could not convert his opportunities either  particularly the drop goal late on.  it wasn t a good strike   he added.  i felt as soon as it hit my boot it had missed. it s very disappointing  but i must recover.  andy robinson said he would  keep working on the kicking  with his squad. however  the england coach added that he would take some positives from the defeat.   we went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have france done   he said.  they won the game from kicking penalties from our 10m line.  it s very frustrating. the lads showed a lot of ambition in the first half  they went out to sustain it in the second but couldn t build on it.  we took the ball into contact  and you know when you do that it is a lottery whether the referee is going to give the penalty to your side or the other side.  we have lost a game we should have won. there is a fine line between winning and losing  and for the second week we ve been on the wrong side of that line and it hurts.   england went in at half-time with a 17-6 lead but they failed to score in the second half and dimitri yachvili slotted over four penalties as france overhauled the deficit. england skipper jason robinson admitted his side failed to cope with france s improved second-half display.   we controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after half-time   he said.  we made a lot of mistakes in the second half and they punished us. they took their chances when they came.  it s very disappointing. last week we lost by two points  now one point.
hewitt falls to dent in adelaide lleyton hewitt suffered a shock defeat to taylor dent in the quarter-finals of the australian hardcourt championships in adelaide on friday.  the top seed was a strong favourite for the title but went down 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 to the american. dent will face juan ignacio chela next after the fourth seed was too strong for jurgen melzer. olivier rochus beat third seed nicolas kiefer 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (8-6) 7-5 and will take on second seed joachim johansson. the swede reached the last four by beating compatriot thomas enqvist 6-3 4-6 6-1.  i felt like i was striking the ball much better   said johansson.   i felt like i had a lot of break chances  i didn t take care of them all  but i broke him four times and he only broke me once.  i felt that was the key to get up in the set early.  hewitt played down his defeat and insisted he is focused solely on the australian open  which starts on 17 january.  when you ve been number one in the world for a couple of years and won a couple of slams  you look at the big picture and what motivates you   said hewitt.  that s the grand slams and melbourne s as big for me as any of the four. even if i don t win sydney next week it s no big deal.
blunkett unveils policing plans people could be given the mobile phone number of their local bobby under an overhaul of policing in england and wales unveiled by david blunkett.  the plans include a dedicated policing team for each neighbourhood and a 10 point compulsory customer charter. the home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police. local people would also be able to  trigger  action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done. local councillors would have to show certain conditions had been met before invoking the power. and police could refuse the request if the complaints were frivolous  would only cause annoyance or would pose too heavy a burden on resources.  mr blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police. the best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms  he said  but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed. the home secretary s powers to suspend or sack chief constables are being reviewed after mr blunkett s battle with humberside chief david westwood over intelligence failures on soham murderer ian huntley.  opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork. tory spokesman david davis said the proposals were  little more than a taxpayer-funded pr exercise  ahead of a general election predicted for next may.  police forces were already  buried  under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them   said mr davis. earlier lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police.  but these measures will only work if they re matched with a cut in the amount of paperwork - and investment in modern equipment to keep the police out on the streets.   before delivering a statement to mps  mr blunkett was joined by tony blair at welling school  in south east london  which is at the heart of a community policing initiative. mr blunkett said he wanted  to go back to a time when i was very young  when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work . the prime minister said the law-abiding citizen should be in charge of the community and  not the minority who want to cause trouble .  mr blunkett already boasts about producing record police numbers. he has also started to recruit 25 000 community support officers (csos) and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects. an extra £50m was promised on tuesday so 2 000 new csos can be recruited now rather than next year. within two years  every force will be expected to keep to a  coppers  contract  on what kind of service the public can expect. a mori poll this summer suggested policing  unlike health and education  was the one major public service where people were less satisfied the more contact they had with it. the plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted. there will also be  specific exercises  to encourage black and asian people to join the police at senior ranks.
what high-definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video  then it was the dvd  and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.  high-definition gives incredible  3d-like pictures and surround sound. the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so  and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds  it will profoundly change home entertainment. for rick dean  director of business development for digital content company thx  a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy  finding nemo  the incredibles and indiana jones.  there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds   he told the bbc news website.   the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined.  the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master   he says. but currently  putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand.  as much as you compress the picture data rate wise  you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master   he explains.  i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting.   high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to. it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months  time. mr dean is confident though:  i think if they see real hd [high-definition]  not some heavily compressed version of it  there is such a remarkable difference.  i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen.   high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. on the whole  producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. equally  it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd.  when we master movies right now  our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second   says mr dean.  our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second.  that s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98%. so if you have anything that allows more space  you don t have to compress so hard.  studios could fit a lot more marketing material  games  and features  onto high-capacity dvds. currently  an entire dvd project can take up to three months  says mr dean. although the step of down-converting will be bypassed  this will realistically only save a day s work  says mr dean. one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems. on the fairly complex star wars disks  making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. if studios want to cash in on the extra space  it could mean extra human hours  for which someone has to pay.  if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks  it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required.  and if studios do focus on delivering more  added value content   thinks mr dean  ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd. but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price  studios will listen  thinks mr dean.  high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike. more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous.  when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i  everybody was very sun-tanned  but that was make-up.  in the hd version of episode i  all these make-up lines showed up   explains mr dean. the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too.   there are scans of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots  there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways.  you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn t see it.  what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas  this line blurs even further. it could also mean that how we get films  and in what format  will widen.  in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol - broadband]  giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive   says mr dean. but that is some time off for most  and for now  people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves.
council tax rise  reasonable  welsh councils should set their taxes at  reasonable levels  after being given an average funding increase of 6%  says the assembly government.  finance minister sue essex said it was a  good deal  for local government. the £3.2bn settlement includes the  full  £7.4m from the uk treasury announced by chancellor gordon brown. but opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. in addition  £13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. she said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was  confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels.  the welsh local government association (wlga) had said on the eve of the announcement said that  significant  cuts to services may still be unavoidable. after the announcement wlga finance spokesman bob wellington  of torfaen  said it was vital that rises were minimsed.  a limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems   said mr wellington.  it is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase.  on monday  a delegation of north wales councils visited ms essex to lobby for increased funds. ms essex said:  i have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises.  i have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and i am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax  particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties.  she said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels   even for those people who have moved up a band .  the settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. ms essex said:  this is a good deal for local government  which will allow the well-managed councils of wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. it is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level.  plaid cymru s local government spokesman dai lloyd called the announcement  hugely disappointing . he said:  wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. this is not whinging as the labour assembly government so often claims - it is anger.   this will mean either a massive hike in council tax  massive cuts in services provided by councils  or both.  mike german  leader of the liberal democrats in the assembly  claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. mr german said:  i know from my discussions with welsh liberal democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. but the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty.  conservative local government spokesman glyn davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in wales should see very little change  is taking spin to the very verge of deception . he added:  around a third of welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.
man utd to open books to glazer manchester united s board has agreed to give us tycoon malcolm glazer access to its books.  earlier this month  mr glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club. in a statement  the club said it would allow mr glazer  limited due diligence  to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid. but it said it continued to oppose mr glazer s plans  calling his assumptions  aggressive  and his plan  damaging . many of manchester united s supporters own shares in the club  and the fan-based group shareholders united is strongly opposed to any takeover by mr glazer. about 300 fans protested outside the old trafford ground two days ago.  rival local club manchester city has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on sunday.  manchester united s response comes as little surprise  as the board made clear.  any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal   the club said in its statement. should it become a firm offer  it should be at a price that  the board is likely to regard as fair  and on terms which  may be deliverable . but it also stressed that it stayed opposed to mr glazer s proposal.  the board continues to believe that mr glazer s business plan assumptions are aggressive   the statement said   and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging.  whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms  in the case of manchester united many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons. at present  mr glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake  making them manchester united s second biggest shareholders. they own the successful tampa bay buccaneers american football team based in florida. if the family makes a formal offer  they will need the support of the club s biggest shareholders.  irish horse racing millionaires jp mcmanus and john magnier own 29% of united through their investment vehicle cubic expression  and have yet to express a view on the bid approach.  a group of five mps are calling on the department of trade and industry to block any takeover of the club by the us football magnate on public interest grounds. they have signed a house of commons motion  and tony lloyd  the manchester central mp  whose constituency includes the club s old trafford ground  has pledged to take the matter  to tony blair if necessary . the commons motion says  any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football . however  the dti has dismissed the proposal. a spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the enterprise act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non-competition grounds. mr glazer s offer values the club at £800m ($1.5bn). pitched at 300p per share  it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the us tycoon  which was rejected out of hand. manchester united shares closed at 270.25p on friday  down 3.75p on the day.
soderling wins tense milan final fifth seed robin soderling took the milan indoors title with a dramatic win over radek stepanek in sunday s final.  the 20-year-old swede edged the final set tie-break for a 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-5) victory and his second tour title after winning in lyon last year.  i m delighted to have won against such a good opponent in a tournament of this importance   said soderling.  i was really on form  my service was good and i really liked playing on the synthetic surface.  soderling  the world number 37  shrugged off a nervous start to take the opening set on his first set point. a change in approach from fourth seed stepanek in the second set paid dividends as he took it on a tie-break  but soderling s superior power proved too much in the third.
tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were  robbed  at manchester united after pedro mendes  shot clearly crossed the line but was not given.   the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can t we just stop the game and get the decision right   said jol after the 0-0 draw.  but at the end of the day it s so obvious that pedro s shot was over the line it s incredible.  we feel robbed but it s difficult for the linesman and referee to see it.  mendes shot from 50 yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear. jol added:  we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line  it was a metre inside the goal.  what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005  watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn t told about it.   we didn t play particularly well but i am pleased - even now - with a point  although we should have had three.  mendes could not believe the  goal  was not given after seeing a replay. he said:  my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate.  it was a very nice goal  it was clearly over the line - i ve never seen one so over the line and not given in my career.  it s really  really over. what can you do but laugh about it  it s a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn t count.  it s not every game you score from the halfway line.  manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology.  i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that s that technology should play a part in the game   ferguson told mutv.  what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays.  but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can t make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.   thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. so you wouldn t be wasting a lot of time.  i think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. i think that would be an opening into a new area of football.  arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology.  when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford  that just reinforces what i feel - there should be video evidence   said wenger.  it s a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.
row threatens hendrix museum plan proposals to open a museum dedicated to jimi hendrix are flailing because of a row over the home of his late father.  the run-down house in seattle has already been moved wholesale once and local authorities are now demanding it be moved to another site. hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist.  the mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed jimi hendrix s house   said ray rae marshall of the james marshall hendrix foundation. the foundation moved the building  in which al hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956  when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002. now the city of seattle wants its new plot to be used for development  giving a deadline of 22 february for the home to be moved. mr goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre. seattle officials said no such deal had been offered.   we never said   you can own this property    said john franklin  chief of its operations department.  from our perspective  it was a temporary situation. we have not threatened to demolish the house. we ve simply asked that they have to move it.  now mr goldman is calling for the authority to pay to move the building to seattle s central district  where hendrix grew up. janie hendrix  the guitarist s stepsister  said the family were still hoping the guitarist would be honoured by having a road named after him.  that s something my father really wanted to see   she said.  it would be nice if we didn t have to fight for everything to get it.  hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time. he died of drug overdose in 1970 at the age of 27.
celtic unhappy over bulgaria date martin o neill hopes to block stilian petrov s call-up by bulgaria during celtic s busy festive programme.  the celtic manager does not view the friendly against valenciana - a region of spain - on 28 december as important.  i can t say i was overly pleased at the fixture being played just after christmas   said o neill.  we will have to speak with the bulgarian fa. it s their prerogative for them to arrange a fixture and our prerogative how we handle it.  bulgaria s game comes between celtic s boxing day meeting with hearts and their 2 january fixture against livingston. o neill believes the extra game will not help a midfielder whose season has already been affected by injury.  they have organised a game at a rather awkward time   he added.  when we were out playing barcelona  i spoke with the bulgarian manager  hristo stoichkov  and he mentioned this game to me.  we pay his wages  we are the ones that if an awkward fixture is going to be played at some stage or another it should be to our benefit  rather than anyone else.  i have said this before  but bulgaria are the one nation who seem to organise a lot of friendly games.
more power to the people says hp the digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories  according to carly fiorina  chief of technology giant hewlett packard.  the job of firms such as hp now  she said in a speech at the consumer electronics show (ces)  was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. she said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. ces showcases 50 000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. the tech-fest  the largest of its kind in the world  runs from 6 to 9 january.  the digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible   she told delegates.  revolution has always been about giving power to the people.  she added:  the real story of the digital revolution is not just new products  but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell.  part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content  such as images  video and music. crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device  such as a digital camera  to others  such as portable media players. a lot of work still needs to be done  however  to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly  she said.  ms fiorina s talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle  fashion and personalisation  something she sees as key to what people want.  special guest  singer gwen stefani  joined her on-stage to promote her own range of hp digital cameras which ms stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by japanese youth culture. the digital cameras  which are due to go on sale in the us by the summer  are based on the hp 607 model. the emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year s ces  with tiny  wearable mp3 players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. ms fiorina also announced that hp was working with nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles  which would launch in europe early this year. the service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content  like a track s ringtone  simultaneously. the service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive.  among the other new products she showcased was the digital media hub  a big upgrade to hp s digital entertainment centre. coming out in the autumn in the us  the box is a networked  high-definition tv  cable set-top box  digital video recorder and dvd recorder. it has a removable hard drive cartridge  memory card slots  and light scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised dvd labels and covers. it is designed to contain all a household s digital media  such as pre-recorded tv shows  pictures  videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. the hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the pc so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. research suggests that about 258 million images are saved and shared every day  equating to 94 billion a year. eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. ms fiorina was one of several keynote speakers  who also included microsoft chief bill gates  to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next 12 months. in a separate announcement during the keynote speech  ms fiorina said that hp would be partnering mtv to replace this year s mtv asia music award. mtv s asia aid will be held in bangkok on 3 february  and is aimed at helping to raise money for the asian tsunami disaster.
blinx sequel purrs nicely the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft s then new xbox console.  its sharp graphics and novel gameplay  with the main character able to pause  slow  rewind and fast-forward time  were meant to lure many fans to the new machine. but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half-way through a level without the required tools to finish. thankfully  the sequel has fixed many of the original faults. this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters.  the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game.  as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions  pig and feline  assuming the role of your created characters. the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal. as in the original  your feline persona can control time  but this time the pigs get to control space. there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps  space bubbles and void traps in order to progress. the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr-style icons and is quite intuitive.  annoyingly  the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them. the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps2 and so there are a number of combat elements. these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair. but the game s excellent graphics  easily the best-looking platform game around  sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans.  blinx 2 is out on xbox now.
labour s four little words labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which  for those just returned from the planet galifray  is  looming .  the slogan  britain forward not back  (no  it s not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary time lords) is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky - it s always there but we mostly stop noticing. the word  britain  is cast on a red background - a nod to old labour.  forward  is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and  along with  not back   is set against a mushy pea green background. as one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared  it was all very post modern  or something. great use of colour. those ad men really do earn their money. and  coincidentally  the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called  fagin  posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but  as election supremo alan milburn declared   are doing a very good job .  mr milburn  in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning  explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony blair are the future while michael howard and the tories would take the country backwards.  not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days   he declared. it would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between labour and the tories.  nobody  he claimed  could picture liberal democrat leader charles kennedy walking up downing street the day after polling. they could  however  picture michael howard or  of course  tony blair doing it. so it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition s policies and past record. and tony blair would be in the very front line of that campaign  he said.  between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of london than in it but in britain  not overseas   he promised.  he will be leading the domestic debate from the front  listening  taking the flak.  so  let s get on with it then.
henman to face saulnier test british number one tim henman will face france s cyril saulnier in the first round of next week s australian open.  greg rusedski  the british number two  is in the same quarter of the draw and could face andy roddick in the second round if he beats swede jonas bjorkman. local favourite lleyton hewitt will meet france s arnaud clement  while defending champion and world number one roger federer faces fabrice santoro. women s top seed lindsay davenport drew spanish veteran conchita martinez.  henman came from two sets down to defeat saulnier in the first round of the french open last year  so he knows he faces a tough test in melbourne. the seventh seed  who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year s first major and is lined up to meet roddick in the last eight  is looking forward to the match.  he s tough player on any surface  he s got a lot of ability   he said.  we had a really tight one in paris that went my way so i m going to need to play well from the outset because he s a dangerous competitor.  switzerland s federer  seeded one  is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. he has beaten santoro in five of their seven previous encounters  but is taking nothing for granted.  it s a tricky match   federer said.  i played him at the us open and won quite comfortably then. but you never know  if the rhythm is a bit off  he can keep you guessing and make it difficult.  the most important thing  though  is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them.  the 23-year-old could meet four-time champion andre agassi in the quarter-finals before meeting russian marat safin  the player he beat in last year s final.  eighth-seeded american agassi is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which ruled him out of the kooyong classic. second seed andy roddick will open his campaign against irakli labadze of georgia. the american could meet rusedski in the second round  seventh seed henman in the quarter-finals and hewitt in the last four. hewitt is hoping to become the first australian man to win the event since mark edmondson in 1976. the 23-year-old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at melbourne park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to federer  who beat him in the australian open  wimbledon and us open last year. safin  seeded four  opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed tommy haas  the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002  a possible fourth-round opponent.  in the women s draw  davenport could encounter eighth-seeded venus williams in the quarter-finals and third-ranked anastasia myskina  the french open champion  in the semi-finals. bronchitis ruled davenport  the 2000 australian open champion  out of her sydney quarter-final on thursday. venus williams  who lost to younger sister serena in the melbourne final two years ago  opens against eleni daniilidou of greece. serena williams  who won her fourth consecutive grand slam at the 2003 australian open  was drawn in the bottom quarter with second seed amelie mauresmo  a runner-up in 1999. serena will open against another frenchwoman camille pin  while mauresmo plays australia s samantha stosur. wimbledon champion maria sharapova  seeded fourth  drew a qualifier in the first round but could meet fellow

howard attacks  pay later  budget tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown s budget as  vote now  pay later  spending plans.  the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole  mr howard said. everyone could see the chancellor s  sweeteners   but these hid tax rises for hard working families  he said. labour s  faltering election campaign  would not be helped by the package of measures  mr howard added.  mr brown s budget was not about what was good for the country  but  all about the interests of the labour party   the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging  millions of people in to the net  to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax.  we can all see the sweeteners  but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if labour wins.   he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced.  their only answer is to tax  to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.  mr brown liked to rattle off  magical balances conjured out of thin air  in a bid to convince people there was no  black hole  in the nation s finances  the tory leader said.  this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers   he said.  you now propose to borrow  over the next six years  no less than £168 billion; so much for prudence.  the chancellor s forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister s forecasts of weapons of mass destruction.   mr brown s council tax rebate for pensioners was £300 less than what the tories were offering  mr howard said. there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets  make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. people would face a  clear choice  at the election  either  more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives   he said.  that s the battleground of this election. that s what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on   he concluded  to loud tory cheering.
kelly trails new discipline power teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a  zero tolerance  drive  education secretary ruth kelly has suggested.  ms kelly told the bbc progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems. the minister also confirmed she received  spiritual support  from the catholic movement opus dei. but she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs.  the conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the run-up to the next general election. ms kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight. she told bbc one s breakfast with frost:  it is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom.  we have made huge progress on the really difficult cases  the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour.   but quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled.  i would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision.  it is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes. head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school  who sexually abuse pupils or other people  who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour. ms kelly entered the cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then home secretary david blunkett. her links to opus dei  which means  work of god  in latin  have provoked controversy.  critics say the organisation  which adheres strictly to catholic teachings  is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims. asked if she was a member of the group  ms kelly said:  i do have spiritual support from opus dei and that is right.  but those are private spiritual matters and i m sure you ll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life.  she categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister. her collective responsibility as a cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas  she argued.  the government has yet to issue its official response to the tomlinson review  which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma. ms kelly said reforms should build on gcses and a-levels. her comments did not impress tory shadow education secretary tim collins.  ruth kelly wants to ditch the tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place   he said.  she also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how. this is an all talk agenda that lets down children  teachers and parents.
ukip candidate suspended in probe eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.  john houston  54  was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views  including the return of the british empire  were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip  soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be  made available to law-abiding members of the community  and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said:  we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire.  the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale  and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations  which they are uniquely able to do.  mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy  which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party s manifesto  but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. he told bbc news:  he appears to have said these things. we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate.  by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting.  it is simply a distraction from the task in hand  the eu constitution  not individual idiocies.  mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying:  i feel ukip have over-reacted and overshot the runway.   peter nielson  who is ukip scotland chairman  said he had suspended mr houston on friday night.  he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.  he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party. he added:  i can t comment too much at the moment  i have one version from him but i haven t seen the papers yet.
bt program to beat dialler scams bt is introducing two initiatives to help beat rogue dialler scams  which can cost dial-up net users thousands.  from may  dial-up net users will be able to download free software to stop computers using numbers not on a user s  pre-approved list . inadvertently downloaded by surfers  rogue diallers are programs which hijack modems and dial up a premium rate number when users log on. thousands of uk dial-up users are believed to have been hit by the scam. some people have faced phone bills of up to £2 000. bt s modem protection program will check numbers that are dialled by a computer and will block them if they have not been pre-approved  such as national and net service provider numbers. icstis  the uk s premium rate services watchdog  said it had been looking for companies to take the lead in initiatives.  the initiatives are very welcome   a spokesperson from icstis told the bbc news website.  we are very pleased to see they are putting into place new measures to protect consumers.   the second initiative bt announced is an early warning system which will alert bt customers if there is unusual activity on their phone bills. if a bill rises substantially above its usual daily average  or if a call is made to a suspect number  a text or voice alert will be sent to the user s landline phone. as part of the clamp-down on rogue diallers  companies must now satisfy stringent conditions  including clear terms and conditions  information about how to delete diallers and responsibility for customer refunds. any firm running a dialler without permission can now be closed down by icstis. the watchdog brought in the action last october following a decision to license all companies which wanted to operate legitimate premium rate dialler services.  there are legitimate companies who offer services such as adult content  sports results and music downloads by charging a premium rate rather than by credit card bt said it had ploughed an enormous amount of effort into protecting people from the problem. it has already barred more than 1 000 premium rate numbers and has tried to raise public awareness about the scams.  we now want to ensure there are even stronger safeguards for our customers  who we would urge to make use of these new options to protect themselves   said gavin patterson  group managing director for consumer the arm of bt. both schemes have been undergoing trials in ireland  and will be made available to 20 million bt customers from may.
argonaut founder rebuilds empire jez san  the man behind the argonaut games group which went into administration a week ago  has bought back most of the company.  the veteran games developer has taken over the cambridge-based just add monsters studios and the london subsidiary morpheme. the argonaut group went into administration due to a severe cash crisis  firing about half of its staff. in august it had warned of annual losses of £6m for the year to 31 july.  jez san is one of the key figures in the uk s games industry. the developer  who received an obe in 2002  was estimated to have been worth more than £200m at the peak of the dotcom boom.  he founded argonaut in 1982 and has been behind titles such as 1993 starfox game. more recently it was behind the harry potter games for the playstation. but  like all software developers  argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers. in august it warned of annual losses of £6m  blaming delays in signing new contracts and tough conditions in the software industry. the group s three subsidiaries were placed in administration a week ago  with mr sans resigning as the company s ceo and some 100 staff being fired. after the latest round of cuts  there were 80 workers at argonaut headquarters in edgware in north london  with 17 at its morpheme offices in kentish town  london  and 22 at the just add monsters base in cambridge. mr san has re-emerged  buying back morpheme and just add monsters.  we are pleased to announce the sale of these two businesses as going concerns   said david rubin of administrators david rubin & partners.  this has saved over 40 jobs as well as the substantial employment claims that would have arisen had the sales not been achieved.  mr rubin said the administrators were in talks over the sale of the argonaut software division in edgware and were hopeful of finding a buyer.  this is a very difficult time for all the employees there  but i salute their commitment to the business while we work towards a solution   he said. some former employees are angry at the way cash crisis was handled. one told bbc news online that the staff who had been fired had been  financially ruined in the space of a day .
putting a face to  big brother  literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets.  imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour  and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist. together with speech and voice recognition systems  they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. some of these ideas have been showcased at the london s science museum  as part of its future face exhibition.  one such avatar is jeremiah. it is a virtual man  which you can download for free and install in your computer.  his creator  richard bowden  lecturer at the centre for vision  speech and signal processing at the university of surrey  refers to jeremiah as  him   rather than it.  jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. he is very childlike  he likes visual stimulus   he told the bbc news website.  when he sees children running and laughing and waving at him  he smiles at them. if you ignore him  he gets angry. if you leave  he gets sad. and you can also even surprise him.  jeremiah is not actually intelligent. it works on vision  reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system. it is not able to talk or to hear you  at least not yet. the surrey team is already working on jeremiah s next version  that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: finn the fish.  i am interested in the interaction  providing the ability of a system to watch what s going on and make decisions based on that   explained dr bowden.  the research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets.  experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices  such as a virtual human  could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos.  if you get up at three o clock in the morning  and you go downstairs  there are probably two things you are going to do: either going to the bathroom  or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea   said dr bowden.  now if the system can watch your behaviour over time  it can learn this  so it would predict what you are going to do  turn on the lights for you  or  before you even get to the kettle  it could have switched it on.  you might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday  and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left. this might sound like a scary vision of an orwellian future. but it might all depend on the face that is watching you.  when we put the surveillance cameras in our centre  a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them   said dr bowden.  but when jeremiah s camera went in  nobody minded  because although it s still watching them  they could see what it was watching.
digital guru floats sub-$100 pc nicholas negroponte  chairman and founder of mit s media labs  says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).  he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be   very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family  village and neighbourhood . he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop  which would run a linux-based operating system   we have to get the display down to below $20  to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.   the second trick is to get rid of the fat   if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.  the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture  though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital  now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine  where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.  while the idea was popular amongst the children  it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however  mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops.  we put in 25 laptops three years ago   only one has been broken  the kids cherish these things  it s also a tv a telephone and a games machine  not just a textbook.  mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious.  nokia make 200 million cell phones a year  so for us to claim we re going to make 200 million laptops is a big number  but we re not talking about doing it in three or five years  we re talking about months.  he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order.  in china they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. that s for five or six years  so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.

dame julie pops in to see poppins mary poppins star dame julie andrews watched the hit stage version of her classic film at a charity performance in london s west end.  it was the first time dame julie  who shot to fame as the nanny in the 1964 disney movie  had seen the musical  staged at the prince edward theatre. she watched laura michelle kelly  23  reprise the role on stage. the show has been one of the west end s hottest tickets since opening in december  winning two olivier awards. kelly was named best musical actress at last month s ceremony and the musical also won best choreography.  but kelly said she was  very nervous  about meeting dame julie because she was  my absolute hero . the gala performance saw dame julie  69  return to the theatre where she had her first starring role in a performance of humpty dumpty in 1948. the mary poppins musical has been masterminded by theatre impresario sir cameron mackintosh and directed by richard eyre with choreography by matthew bourne. sir cameron said he hoped the production  which cost £9m to bring to the stage  was a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book by pl travers. proceeds from thursday s show will go to charities including absolute return for kids (ark)  international relief agency operation usa and drama school lamda.

mirza makes indian tennis history teenager sania mirza completed a superb week at the hyderabad open by becoming the first indian in history to win a wta singles title.  in front of a delirious home crowd  the 18-year-old battled past alyona bondarenko of the ukraine 6-4 5-7 6-3. mirza  ranked 134 in the world  sunk to her knees in celebration after serving out the match against bondarenko.  it is a big moment in my career and i would like to thank everyone who has been a part of my effort   she said.  this win has made me believe more in myself and i can now hope to do better in the coming days.  i wanted to win this tournament very badly since it was in my hometown.  at the australian open in january  mirza became the first indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam before losing to eventual champion serena williams.  and a year ago  she became the youngest indian to win a professional title by claiming the doubles at the hyderabad open. mirza  playing in her first wta final  began nervously in front of a raucous home crowd - committing three double faults in her opening service game. but from 0-2 down  mirza broke serve twice in a row and held on to her advantage to take the first set. in a see-saw second set  bondarenko raced into a 5-2 lead and though mirza hauled herself level  the ukrainian broke again before finally levelling the match. mirza rediscovered the aggressive strokes that took her to the first set in the decider established a 5-2 lead. at 5-3  the stadium erupted in celebration when mirza thought she had delivered an ace to secure victory but the serve was ruled to have clipped the net. mirza eventually lost the point but to the relief of the crowd  she broke bondarenko again in the next game to clinch the title.
giving financial gifts to children your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this christmas  but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future   gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. it may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs  for example.  the government is trying to encourage saving at an early age  through its new child trust fund. the first vouchers  worth £250 or £500 for low-income families  will be distributed from january. all children born after 1st september 2002 will be eligible. parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in april 2005.  parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £1 200 a year  which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. as the child trust fund will not be in force in time for christmas  relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children s deposit account  and use this as a feeder fund.  there are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the ladybird account from the saffron walden building society  paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of £1 and the alliance & leicester firstsaver which pays 5.25%  also starting at £1.  interest earned by children is subject to income tax. however  children  like adults  have a personal income tax allowance (£4 745 for the current tax year).  if the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. as long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance  then no tax will be payable. when the account is opened a form  r85   available from the bank or building society  should be completed. this confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.  the tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. where interest exceeds this level  the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. this is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child  consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents  gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. therefore  it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the child trust fund which is tax free  with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £1 200 limit being directed to a deposit account.  another favourite solution is premium bonds. with the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account  they make great presents. the parent or guardian will be responsible for the bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. any prizes will be sent to the parent or child s guardian. the minimum for each purchase is £100 and bonds are sold in multiples of £10.  there are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored.  over the longer term  stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment  although in the shorter term they can be volatile. one of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. one way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. these are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. these funds may be actively managed  where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential  or passive  where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index  for example  the ftse 100. exchange traded funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. these are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). the difference is that the charges are quite low. the only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18  and parents will have no control over how it is spent. for larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.
s korean credit card firm rescued south korea s largest credit card firm has averted liquidation following a one trillion won ($960m; £499m) bail-out.  lg card had been threatened with collapse because of its huge debts but the firm s creditors and its former parent have stepped in to rescue it. a consortium of creditors and lg group  a family owned conglomerate  have each put up $480m to stabilise the firm. lg card has seven million customers and its collapse would have sent shockwaves through the country s economy.  the firm s creditors - which own 99% of lg card - have been trying to agree a deal to secure its future for several weeks. they took control of the company in january when it avoided bankruptcy only through a $4.5bn bail-out.  they had threatened to delist the company  a move which would have triggered massive debt redemptions and forced the company into bankruptcy  unless agreement was reached on its future funding.  lg card will not need any more financial aid after this   laah chong-gyu  executive director of korea development bank - one of the firm s creditors - said.  the agreement will see some 12 trillion won of debt converted into equity.  the purpose of the capital injection is to avoid delisting and the goal will be met   david kim  an analyst at sejong securities  told reuters. south korea s consumer credit market has been slowly recovering from a crisis in 2002 when a credit bubble burst and millions of consumers fell behind on their debt repayments. lg card returned to profit in september but needed further capital to avoid being thrown off the market. south korea s stock exchange can delist any firm if its debt exceeds its assets two years running.
us budget deficit to reach $368bn the us budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (£197bn) this year  officials said on tuesday.  the cost of military operations still needs to be factored in  with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $100bn in the red. past congressional budget office (cbo) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year. in recent months  the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. in november  the gap between us exports and imports widened to more than $60bn  a record figure. the cbo says it envisages a further  orderly  decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. but the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost us economic growth.  the budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 september 2004  after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year. the cbo also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015  an improvement on previous projections. however  analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president s plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. the figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 september attacks and ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan. one of president george w bush s election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. but democrats have accused the president of excluding iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit  a charge which the administration denies. on tuesday  the us administration asked congress for additional funds for military operations.
britain boosted by holmes double athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals.  kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games. holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over team gb after their biggest medal hope  paula radcliffe  dropped out of the marathon and then the 10 000m. britain s men s 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. holmes had started the year in disappointing style  falling over in the final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite. her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. just five days later  the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double. while holmes left athens as the star of team gb  it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games.  the 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. her decision to enter the 10 000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining.  but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in november s new york marathon. the 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the british men s olympic squad after a poor start to the games.  it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. but darren campell  jason gardener  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis made amends in the sprint relay. the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britain s first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and  just like holmes  finally lived up to his promise in 2004. kelly sotherton completed team gb s athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. the 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003.  but it was a different story for britain s defending champion denise lewis  who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. lewis  who was troubled by injury  has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success. the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley  who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. the battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze.  and backley s departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete dean macey  who came fourth in athens.  the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb. sadly  the 2004 olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. on the eve of the games  greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash.  kenteris  the 200m champion in 2000  and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial. at the games  adrian annus (hammer)  robert fazelas (discus) and irina korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol.  the fallout from the thg scandal  which rocked the sport in 2003  continued to impact in olympic year. britain s 4x100m team took gold without the services of dwain chambers  who was handed a two-year ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg.  american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. and world 400m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence. russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles. her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events. morocco s hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the 1500m and 5 000m.  and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon  there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles. rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.

england children s tsar appointed the first children s commissioner for england has been appointed.  great ormond street hospital professor of child health  al aynsley-green  was chosen by the government and will start the £100 000-a-year job immediately. he will oversee a £2.5m annual budget and have the power to look into  any matter relating to the interests and well-being of children . prof aynsley-green has also been the national clinical director for children in the department of health. he promised to make sure that children s opinions  count .   i will be drawing on my experience of working with children and young people to help ensure that those with the power to improve children s lives do live up to their responsibilities.  i want all children and young people to know that they can approach me to discuss any matter that affects them  knowing that i will value their opinion.  education secretary ruth kelly said prof aynsley-green would  strengthen the voice of children and young people . prof aynsley-green was a lecturer at oxford university  trained at guy s hospital medical school  university of london; oriel college  oxford; and in switzerland. he is described as  a proud grandfather  of four. scotland  wales and northern ireland already have children s commissioners.
continental  may run out of cash  shares in continental airlines have tumbled after the firm warned it could run out of cash.  in a filing to us regulators the airline warned of  inadequate liquidity  if it fails to reduce wage costs by $500m by the end of february. continental also said that  if it did not make any cuts  it expects to lose  hundreds of millions of dollars  in 2005 in current market conditions. failure to make cutbacks may also push it to reduce its fleet  the group said. shares in the fifth biggest us carrier had fallen 6.87% on the news to $10.44 by 1830 gmt.  without the reduction in wage and benefit costs and a reasonable prospect of future profitability  we believe that our ability to raise additional money through financings would be uncertain   continental said in its filing to the us securities and exchange commission (sec).  airlines have faced tough conditions in recent years  amid terrorism fears since the 11 september world trade centre attack in 2001. but despite passengers returning to the skies  record-high fuel costs and fare wars prompted by competition from low cost carriers have taken their toll. houston-based continental now has debt and pension payments of nearly $984m which it must pay off this year. the company has been working to streamline its operations - and has managed to save $1.1bn in costs without cutting jobs. two weeks  ago the group also announced it would be able to shave a further $48m a year from its costs with changes to wage and benefits for most of its us-based management and clerical staff.
podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10 000 songs  which is a lot of space to fill.  but more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. it is called  podcasting  and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod  although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. a podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create  usually in the comfort of their own home. they need only a microphone  a pc  and some editing software. they then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them  all for free. using technology based on xml computer code and rss - really simple syndication - listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software  which mr curry has pioneered. the latest mp3 files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically.  mr curry records  hosts  edits and produce a daily  40 minute podcast called the daily source code. he wants to make podcasting  the next big thing  and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry.  i was always into technologies and wires   he explains.  my parents gave me the radio shack 101 project kit  which allows you to build an am transmitter and subsequently an fm transmitter.  i had my mom drive me around the block  see how far it would reach on the car radio.   mr curry is american  but he grew up in the netherlands where he hosted illegal  pirate radio shows in the dutch capital. he tried university in the us  and ended up back in holland where he hosted a music video show. he spent the next seven years in new york where he worked at mtv hosting the top 20 video countdown  but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet.  at a certain point in 1995  i was driving in on a friday afternoon  beautiful blue sky  one of those beautiful days thinking  this is so stupid.  you know  i m going do the top 20 countdown  take the cheque  go home  and sit on the internet until three in the morning.  so  after i finished the show  i quit. i said  on air  it s been great  i ve been here for seven years at that point  there s something on the internet  i ve got to go find it  and i ll see you later.   but mr curry s technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high-speed internet connections were becoming more widely available. the mp3 format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before.  most importantly  mr curry says  people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing.  listen to 99% of the radio that you hear today  it s radio voices  and it s fake  it s just fake.  he wanted to make it easier for people to find  real voices  on the internet. he wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like  ipods. mr curry is not a computer programmer  so he asked others to create one for him. no one did  so he tried to write one himself. he finished it a few months ago and says it  totally sucked.  he put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it; the result is a work in progress called  ipodder . doug kaye  a california-based podcaster  praises the former mtv vj for what he has done.  adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem. ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the mp3 player   he explains.  people can wake up in the morning  pick up their ipods as they go to work or before they go exercise  and discover that there s all this new content automatically put onto their players.  it is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in australia  finland  brazil  even malaysia. one couple broadcasts theirs  the dawn and drew show  from wisconsin in the us  sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed. topics range from the comfort of their bed  to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners.  already  websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts.  chris mcintyre runs podcast alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know-how to simply listen.  if i were to tell my mom  or my mother-in-law to copy an xml or rss file to their podcast aggregator  they would think i was speaking a foreign language   mr mcintyre says. along with technical challenges  there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite  albeit copyrighted  music. some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the  anti-radio  into something that is more like conventional broadcasting. already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world. heineken is doing its own podcast now  and so is playboy. for his part  adam curry s pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be. he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences. he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which  he says   is a badge i ll wear with great honour.  to be the johnny carson  or ed sullivan of anything is wonderful. and you know what  you don t need a hell of a lot of talent.  you just have to be nice  have your ears open  and let people shine. and that s good for me.   clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.
finnan says irish can win group steve finnan believes the republic of ireland can qualify directly for the world cup finals.  after saturday s superb display in the draw in paris  ireland face minnows the faroe islands in dublin on wednesday. the versatile finnan  who starred against the french  is confident the group is ireland s for the taking.  there is a chance for us now to go on  win our home games and why not win the group  even though it s a tough one   said the liverpool player. switzerland  ireland  france and israel are all now tied on five points from three matches - although the republic look to have a slight edge after claiming away draws in basel and paris.  in basel we did not play great football  but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game.  in paris  we looked good throughout the team and a point was the least we deserved because we had a number of chances.   looking back  we had an opportunity to get the three points  but we are happy with a point and that will give us confidence going into wednesday s game.  on paper  we have got the toughest matches out of the way and we have set standards for ourselves.  automatic qualification is there. it would certainly be good to avoid a play-off  but on the back of a couple of good results i don t see why we can t win the group.  manager brian kerr was keen to mention the contribution of stephen carr and finnan on ireland s right flank at the stade de france. finnan s normal position is right-back but he looked assured in a more advanced position against the french.  as i play on the right for my club and being a natural right-back  it was something he (kerr) looked at because france play strongly down the left-hand side.  so i was happy to play and stephen carr and i enjoyed the game  particularly as the defence and midfield held together well and nullified their attacks.
brits return keane to number one brits success has helped return keane s award-winning album hopes and fears back to the top of the uk album chart.  the debut album  which took the best british album title at the brits on tuesday  moved up seven places from number eight to number one. also capitalising on brits success were the scissor sisters whose eponymous album moved three places to number two. u2 s latest single sometimes you can t make it on your own took the top spot in the singles chart  ahead of elvis. the track  from their current album how to dismantle an atomic bomb  pushed eminem s like toy soldiers from number one to number three.  elvis  wooden heart  which entered the chart at number two  is the sixth in a series of 18 reissues to mark the 70th anniversary of presley s birth. there are currently six re-released elvis  tracks occupying spots in the top 40 singles chart including are you lonesome tonight at number 20  it s now or never at number 27 and jailhouse rock at number 37. soldier  by destiny s child  ti and lil wayne  debuted at number four  while almost here  the duet from former westlife star brian mcfadden and delta goodrem  fell from number three to number five. there was more follow up to brits success for franz ferdinand won best rock act and best british group last week. their self-titled album moved from 13 to number four. last week s number one album tourist  by athlete  fell to number three.
fockers keeps us box office lead film comedy meet the fockers  sequel to meet the parents  has topped the us box office for a third week.  the movie  which stars ben stiller  robert de niro  dustin hoffman and barbra streisand  took $28.5m (£15.2m)  making a total of 204.3m (£109m). michael keaton thriller white noise was second with $24m (£12.8m) despite negative reviews. martin scorsese s howard hughes biopic the aviator came third with $7.6m (£4m) and a total of $42.9m (£22.8m). children s adventure lemony snicket s a series of unfortunate events  starring jim carrey and meryl streep  fell two places to fourth position with $7.4m (£3.9m).  it is also the ninth jim carrey film to hit the $100m (£53.2m) mark  according to exhibitor relations. and fat albert  a live-action adaptation of bill cosby s tv cartoon  fell one place to number five  with takings over the three days beginning on friday of $5m (£2.6m). ocean s twelve took sixth place in the us chart with $5.4m (£2.8m)  but it led the non-us chart at the weekend  according to hollywood reporter  with an estimated $17.7m (£9.4m) and total takings of $137m (£73m). the incredibles took $300m (£160m) outside the us  while meet the fockers topped box office charts in australia and mexico with non-us takings of $19.35m (£10.2m).
fbi agent colludes with analyst a former fbi agent and an internet stock picker have been found guilty of using confidential us government information to manipulate stock prices.  a new york court ruled that former fbi man jeffrey royer  41  fed damaging information to anthony elgindy  36. mr elgindy then drove share prices lower by spreading negative publicity via his newsletter. the egyptian-born analyst would extort money from his targets in return for stopping the attacks  prosecutors said.  under the guise of protecting investors from fraud  royer and elgindy used the fbi s crime-fighting tools and resources actually to defraud the public   said us attorney roslynn mauskopf.  mr royer was convicted of racketeering  securities fraud  obstruction of justice and witness tampering. mr elgindy was convicted of racketeering  securities fraud and extortion.  the charges carry sentences of up to 20 years. when the guilty verdict was announced by the jury foreman  mr elgindy dropped his face into his hands and sobbed  the associated press news agency reported. he was led weeping from the court room by us marshals  ap said. defense lawyers contended that mr royer had been feeding information to mr elgindy and another trader in an attempt to expose corporate fraud. mr elgindy s team claimed that he also was fighting against corporate wrongdoing.  elgindy s conviction marks the end of his public charade as a crusader against fraud in the market   said ms mauskopf. one of the more bizarre aspects of the trial focused on the claims that mr elgindy may have had foreknowledge of the 11 september terrorist attacks in new york and washington. mr elgindy had been trying to sell stock prior to the attack and had predicted a slump in the market. no charges were brought in relation to these allegations.
khodorkovsky quits yukos shares jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky has transferred his controlling stake in oil giant yukos to a business partner.  mr khodorkovsky handed over his entire 59.5% stake in holding company group menatep - which controls yukos - to leonid nevzlin. a close ally of the ex-yukos boss  mr nevzlin is currently based in israel. mr khodorkovsky handed over his stake after the forced sale of yukos  core oil production unit  yuganskneftegaz to pay a giant tax bill.  yuganskneftegaz was sold off at auction in december last year  eventually falling into the hands of state oil firm rosneft in a deal worth $9.4bn (£5bn).  since the sale of yuganskneftegaz  i have been delivered of (all) responsibility for the business that remains and the group s money as a whole   mr khodorkovsky said.  it is all over. as before  i see my future in public activity to build a civil society in russia.  mr nevzlin is yukos  largest shareholder but is living in self-imposed exile in israel. yuganskneftegaz pumps around 1 million barrels of oil a day. it was sold by the russian authorities to recover government tax claims against yukos totalling over $27bn. previously considered to be russia s richest man  with an estimated fortune of $15bn  mr khodorkovsky is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion following his arrest in october 2003. however  the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of a drive by russian president vladimir putin to rein in the country s super-rich business leaders  the so-called oligarchs. it is also believed that mr khodorkovsky was particularly targeted because he had started to bankroll political opponents of mr putin.
uk bank seals south korean deal uk-based bank standard chartered said it would spend $3.3bn (£1.8bn) to buy one of south korea s main retail banks.  standard chartered said acquiring korea first bank (kfb) fulfilled a strategic objective of building a bigger presence in asia s third largest economy. its shares fell nearly 3% in london as the bank raised funds for the deal by selling new stocks worth £1bn ($1.8bn)  equal to 10% of its share capital. standard chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from kfb.  the south korean bank will also make up 22% of the group s total assets. the move  a year after citigroup beat standard chartered to buy koram bank  would be the south korean financial sector s biggest foreign takeover. this time around  standard chartered is thought to have beaten hsbc to the deal. kfb is south korea s seventh largest bank  with 3 million retail customers  6% of the country s banking market and an extensive branch network.  the country s banking market is three times the size of hong kong s with annual revenues of $44bn. standard chartered has its headquarters in london but does two thirds of its business in asia  and much of the rest in africa.  we re comfortable with the price paid...the key here has been speed and decisiveness in making sure that we won   said standard chartered chief executive mervyn davies at a london press conference. standard chartered said kfb was a  well-managed  conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce  and represented a  significant acquisition in a growth market . in london  standard chartered s sale of 118 million new shares to institutional investors pushed its share price down  and contributing to the ftse 100 s 0.3% decline. standard chartered s shares were 28 pence lower at 925p by midday. some analysts also queried whether standard chartered had overpaid for kfb. the deal  which requires regulatory approval  is expected to be completed by april 2005 and to be earnings accretive in 2006  standard chartered said.  rival banking giant hsbc  which is based in london and hong kong  was also in the running. standard chartered is believed to have gained the initiative by putting together a bid during the christmas break.  they were able to move so quickly it caught hsbc by surprise   the financial times newspaper quoted an insider in the talks as saying. hsbc will now have to wait for the next south korean bank in line to be sold off - thought likely to be korea exchange bank  also currently in the hands of a us group. standard chartered said it was buying 100% of kfb  an agreement that would bring an end to the bank s complex dual ownership. the south korean government owns 51.4% of kfb  while the remaining shareholding  and operational control  are in the hands of us private equity group newbridge capital. newbridge bought its stake during the government s nationalisation of several banks in the wake of the 1997 asia-wide currency crisis which crippled south korea s financial institutions.  south korea s economy is expected to grow by 4.5% this year. although often thought of an export-driven economy  south korea s service sector has overtaken manufacturing in the last decade or so. services now make up roughly 40% of the economy  and consumer spending and retail banking have become increasingly important. in the aftermath of the asian financial crisis  the government encouraged the growth of consumer credit. bad loan problems followed; lg card  the country s biggest credit card provider  has been struggling to avoid bankruptcy for months  for instance. but analysts believe south korea s financial services industry is still in its infancy  offering plenty of scope for new products. standard chartered sees  the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products . since 1999  kfb has been restructured from a wholesale bank into a retail bank focused on mortgage lending  which makes up 45% of its loans.
have hackers recruited your pc  more than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses.  the huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than 100 networks of remotely-controlled machines. the largest network of so-called zombie networks spied on by the team was made up of 50 000 hijacked home computers. data was gathered using machines that looked innocent but which logged everything hackers did to them.  the detailed look at zombie or  bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the honeynet project - a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as  honey pots  to attract hackers and gather information about how they work. while  bot nets have been known about for some time  estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely.  to gather its information the german arm of the honeynet project created software tools to log what happened to the machines they put on the web. getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy. the longest time a honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only a few minutes. the shortest compromise time was only a few seconds. the research found that  once compromised machines tend to report in to chat channels on irc servers and wait instructions from the malicious hacker behind the tools used to recruit the machine. many well-known vulnerabilities in the windows operating system were exploited by  bot net controllers to find and take over target machines. especially coveted were home pcs sitting on broadband connections that are never turned off.  the months of surveillance revealed that the different  bot nets - which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines - are used for a variety of purposes. many are used as relays for spam  to route unwanted adverts to pc users or as launch platforms for viruses. but the research team found that many are put to very different uses. during the monitoring period  the team saw  bot nets used to launch 226 distributed denial-of-service attacks on 99 separate targets. these attacks bombard websites with data in an attempt to overwhelm the target. using a  bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against. one ddos attack was used by one firm to knock its competitors offline. other  bot nets were used to abuse the google adsense program that rewards websites for displaying adverts from the search engine. some networks were used to abuse or manipulate online polls and games. criminals also seem to be starting to use  bot nets for mass identity theft  to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data.  leveraging the power of several thousand bots  it is viable to take down almost any website or network instantly   said the researchers.  even in unskilled hands  it should be obvious that  bot nets are a loaded and powerful weapon.
sir paul rocks super bowl crowds sir paul mccartney wowed fans with a live mini-concert at american football s super bowl - and avoided any janet jackson-style controversies.  the 62-year-old sang hey jude and other beatles songs in a 12-minute set at half-time during the game in florida. last year  jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine  causing outrage among millions of tv viewers and landing the cbs tv network a fine. sir paul  however  did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old sir paul for his second super bowl show.  three years ago  he was invited to perform at the first super bowl after the september 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song freedom. this time  he started off the show  at the alltel stadium in jacksonville  florida  with the beatles numbers drive my car and get back. he then performed a mellow version of live and let die  the james bond theme he recorded with the band wings. finally  he closed the show with a rousing version of hey jude. the former beatle resisted any temptation to refer to janet jackson s headline-grabbing performance last year  instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. the singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second  nipple-gate  were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.  earlier  the black eyed peas and alicia keys had provided the night s other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. black eyed peas singer fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants  but nothing in her performance was likely to upset tv watchdogs. after the controversy last year - which saw cbs fined a record $550 000 (£292 000) by federal regulators - super bowl organisers had turned to producer don mischer to oversee this year s half-time show. his previous production credits included olympic opening and closing ceremonies. the super bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the us  with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. michael jackson  aerosmith  diana ross  gloria estefan and phil collins are among the stars who have previously graced the super bowl stage.
how to make a greener computer the hi-tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware. bill thompson thinks it s about time.  my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as i drove around cambridge. now you can t buy petrol with lead additives  and we re all better off as a result. chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too  reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways.  apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic  mercury  cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves  the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up  with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents. and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient  since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops  mobiles and music players.  one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle. if you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive. a well-designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost. this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling.  they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit  something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears. it is  as they say  about time. we have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment  and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage. the car engine is a case in point: lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder  a phenomenon called  knocking   so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere. redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work  so it took decades before it was done. we re seeing the same thing in the technology industry and  as a result  there are billions of devices  from old mobile phones to antique handhelds  that will have to be recycled in years to come. if apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new mac mini and throwing away their old pc  keeping the monitor and other peripherals.  even if apple does not get its way  four or five-year-old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it s not unreasonable to replace them. but what do we do with the old ones   i ve just looked around my office and i find two monitors  an old 386 pc  two old handhelds  three ancient laptops  four antique mobile phones  a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use. they are all old enough to be hazardous waste - the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead - but it s possible that some of the components could be useful. i could take them up the to the council recycling centre  but it s a 10-mile drive away across town  and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best. here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste  a box for glass  cans and paper that can be recycled  and a black bin for the rest. there are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks. would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too  i d probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box - at least eventually.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.
chelsea sack mutu chelsea have sacked adrian mutu after he failed a drugs test.  the 25-year-old tested positive for a banned substance - which he later denied was cocaine - in october. chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for mutu  a £15.8m signing from parma last season  who may face a two-year suspension. a statement from chelsea explaining the decision read: we want to make clear that chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs.  mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at stamford bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach jose mourinho. chelsea s statement added:  this applies to both performance-enhancing drugs or so-called  recreational  drugs. they have no place at our club or in sport.  in coming to a decision on this case  chelsea believed the club s social responsibility to its fans  players  employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company.  any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as football association rules.  the club totally supports the fa in strong action on all drugs cases.  fifa s disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a six-month ban. and the sport s world governing body has re-iterated their stance over mutu s failed drugs test  maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities.  fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the english fa have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it   said a fifa spokesman. chelsea s move won backing from drug-testing expert michelle verroken. verroken  a former director of drug-free sport for uk sport  insists the blues were right to sack mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so.  chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate.  it was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make.  it is a very clear stance by chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club.  it emerged that mutu had failed a drugs test on october 18 and  although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine. the romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance. the football association has yet to act on mutu s failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case.
johnny cash manager holiff dies the former manager of johnny cash  saul israel holiff  has died at the age of 79  his family said.  mr holiff  who was also a concert promoter  managed cash s career between 1960 and 1973  quitting when he thought the singer s career had peaked.  i was guilty for underestimating him repeatedly   he once said. the canadian music manager  who also managed tommy hunter and the statler brothers  had been in declining health  according to his family. an entrepreneur from an early age  mr holiff served as a rear air gunner in the royal canadian air force during world war ii  afterwards setting up a drive-in restaurant. he briefly dabbled in acting  before setting up offices in nashville and los angeles for his concert and artist promotion business. in 1970  rpm weekly magazine presented holiff with a special award as the canadian music industry s man of the year. mr holiff retired when he was in his late 40s  returning to education as a mature student at the university of victoria  where he graduated with a degree in history. he passed away on 17 march. according to his wishes  there will be no funeral service.
saudi investor picks up the savoy london s famous savoy hotel has been sold to a group combining saudi billionaire investor prince alwaleed bin talal and a unit of hbos bank.  financial details of the deal  which includes the nearby simpson s in the strand restaurant  were not disclosed. the seller - irish-based property firm quinlan private - bought the savoy along with the berkeley  claridge s and the connaught for £750m last year. prince alwaleed s hotel investments include the luxury george v in paris. he also has substantial stakes in fairmont hotels & resorts  which will manage the savoy and simpson s in the strand  and four seasons. fairmont said it planned to invest $48m (£26m) in renovating parts of the savoy including the river room and suites with views over the river thames. work was expected to be completed by summer 2006  fairmont said.
leaders meet over turkish eu bid tony blair has met italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schroeder to talk about turkey entering the eu.  the downing street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an eu summit in brussels later in the week. mr blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring turkey within the recently-expanded eu. italy and germany also favour an early start to talks  but there is scepticism in france and elsewhere. some are worried that turkey s large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the eu difficult.  some are concerned that a change of government could lead to turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted. and many in france would prefer turkey to admit that world war i-era killing of armenians constituted genocide. there are also issues in france and the netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major muslim nation into the eu. but mr blair and the labour government have been the staunchest backers of turkish accession  provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform. mr blair s official spokesman said:  the prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of european councils.  the key issue at this week s council will be that of turkey  but they will also discuss a range of other matters.
observers to monitor uk election ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming uk general election is fairly run.  the move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. a report by two mps committees called on thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. but in a written response to labour mp gordon prentice  the government said it would normally invite observers to any uk election.  junior constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said:  i fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced.  the government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout  which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.  but trial all-postal ballots in four english regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. liberal democrat peer lord greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges  on a scale not seen since the 19th century . thursday s report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) and the department for constitutional affairs (dca). it said that  with the growth of postal voting  there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually  rather than by household. it also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.  figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24  and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. odpm committee chairman andrew bennett said individual voter registration  as opposed to registration by household  should be quickly introduced as it could  dramatically reduce the chances of fraud . but his counterpart on the dca committee  alan beith  said it should be delayed  until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective.  shadow constitutional affairs secretary oliver heald accused the government of  dragging its feet  over  this badly needed measure .  it is vital that we move ahead with the northern ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the britain s electoral system   he said.  the report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in northern ireland when it was introduced in 2002. the report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters  but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. it said incentives to register  such as £20 council tax rebate  were likely to be seen as  gimmicks  and risked undermining the integrity of the system  mps said. instead they called for  imaginative campaigns  to boost interest.
blind student  hears in colour  a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.  victor wong  a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state  had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. to study  space weather  mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. a number of solutions were tried  including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille. mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music  and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.   the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself   mr wong told the bbc news website.  for the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images.  he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. in order to have an exact reference to the screen  a pen and tablet device is used. the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally.  if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it  it wouldn t work that well.   mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a  colour memory  makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision.  as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder  and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears.  the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially  and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images.
aids and climate top davos agenda climate change and the fight against aids are leading the list of concerns for the first day of the world economic forum in the swiss resort of davos.  some 2 000 business and political leaders from around the globe will listen to uk prime minister tony blair s opening speech on wednesday. mr blair will focus on africa s development plans and global warming. earlier in the day came an update on efforts to have 3 million people on anti-aids drugs by the end of 2005. the world health organisation (who) said 700 000 people in poor countries were on life-extending drugs - up from 440 000 six months earlier but amounting to only 12% of the 5.8 million who needed them. a $2bn  funding gap  still stood in the way of hitting the 2005 target  the who said.  the themes to be stressed by mr blair - whose attendance was announced at the last minute - are those he wants to dominate the uk s chairmanship of the g8 group of industrialised states. other issues to be discussed at the five-day conference range from china s  economic power to iraq s future after this sunday s elections. aside from mr blair  more than 20 other world leaders are expected to attend including french president jacques chirac - due to speak by video link after bad weather delayed his helicopter - and south african president thabo mbeki  whose arrival has been delayed by ivory coast peace talks. the ukraine s new president  viktor yushchenko  will also be there - as will newly elected palestinian leader mahmoud abbas. showbiz figures will also put in an appearance  from u2 frontman bono - a well-known campaigner on trade and development issues - to angelina jolie  a goodwill campaigner for the un on refugees.  unlike previous years  protests against the wef are expected to be muted. anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. at the same time  about 100 000 people are expected to converge on the brazilian resort of porto alegre for the world social forum - the so-called  anti-davos  for campaigners against globalisation  for fair trade  and many other causes.  in contrast  the davos forum is dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world s 500 largest companies scheduled to attend. a survey published on the eve of the conference by pricewaterhousecoopers said four in ten business leaders were  very confident  that their companies would see sales rise in 2005. asian and american executives  however  were much more confident than their european counterparts. but the political discussions  focusing on iran  iraq and china  are likely to dominate media attention.
us retail sales surge in december us retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in december  boosted by strong car sales.  seasonally adjusted sales rose 1.2% in the month  compared to 0.1% a month earlier  boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after christmas. sales climbed 8% for the year  the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999  the commerce department added. the gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. dealers were forced to cut prices in december to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started.  the increase in sales during december pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (£265.9bn). sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion however  if automotives are excluded from december s data  retail sales rose just 0.3% on the month. home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well  rising 2.2%. but as well as hitting the shops  more us consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. however  analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the federal reserve bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises.  consumers for now remain willing to spend freely  sustaining the us expansion. given that attitude  the fed remains likely to continue boosting the fed funds rate at upcoming meetings   ubs economist maury harris told reuters.  retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the us. consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 as the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade and the world trade centre attacks. during that time  sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. looking ahead  analysts now expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the high street with consumer spending remaining strong. the belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. the number of americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367 000  the highest rate since september. however  long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since 2001.
chelsea hold arsenal a gripping game between arsenal and chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at highbury.  thierry henry produced a sublime strike to put arsenal ahead but john terry levelled with a powerful header. henry s quickly-taken free-kick put arsenal back in front but eidur gudjohnsen equalised with a header from william gallas  knockback. henry missed a golden chance when he blazed a shot high late on and arsenal also had a penalty appeal rejected. henry s opener had given arsenal the perfect start and set up an enthralling affair. the french striker headed a long cesc faregas ball back to jose antonio reyes from the edge of the chelsea area and immediately saw it headed back into his path from the spaniard. and  with his back to goal  henry finished with aplomb when he took one touch  turned and struck an angled strike past the despairing dive of keeper petr cech. henry epitomised a determination about the arsenal side but chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after 16 minutes.  gunners keeper manuel almunia  who got the nod ahead of jens lehmann  did well to save a well-struck frank lampard shot. but he could not keep out terry s powered header from the resultant corner as arsenal s weakness at set-pieces was again exposed. almost immediately  henry went close and chelsea gathered the loose ball before going straight up the other end where gudjohnsen fluffed an effort. gudjohnsen did not make the same error minutes later when he struck a sweet shot only for almunia to be equal to the task and save. the homes side regained the lead in controversial fashion when robert pires won a dubious free-kick. and  given the option to take the 25-yard set-piece quickly  henry curled in a shot with cech still organising his wall.  this time arsenal did not allow chelsea to level so soon as they went into the break ahead. chelsea brought striker didier drogba on to partner gudjohnsen up front after the interval and the move reaped immediate reward. lampard swung in a cross which gallas knocked back across goal and a deft header from gudjohnsen levelled matters again. chelsea s main threat was coming from crosses and lampard missed a great opportunity as he headed wide when left unmarked at the far post. the second half failed to live up to the thrilling pace of the opening period but there were flashes of brilliance. one of them came from the enigmatic robben when he jinked his way through two arsenal defenders only to see his poked shot saved by almunia.  arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked a excellent chance for henry who put a left-foot shot high from eight yards. subtitute robin van persie could also have nicked a win for the highbury outfit but frustratingly sidefooted just wide. matthieu flamini had a late penal appeal waved away before the final whistle which maintained chelsea five-point premiership lead over arsenal.  almunia  lauren  toure  campbell  cole  pires  flamini  fabregas  reyes (clichy 82)  bergkamp (van persie 82)  henry. subs not used: senderos  hoyte  lehmann.  cole.  henry 2  29.  cech  paulo ferreira  ricardo carvalho (drogba 45)  terry  gallas  duff  tiago (bridge 45)  makelele  lampard  robben  gudjohnsen (parker 77). subs not used: kezman  cudicini.  robben  drogba  lampard.  terry 17  gudjohnsen 46.  38 153  g poll (hertfordshire).
wilkinson return  unlikely  jonny wilkinson looks set to miss the whole of the 2005 rbs six nations.  england s world cup-winning fly-half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship. but rob andrew  coach of wilkinson s club side newcastle  said that with only two games left to play wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time.  it would be irresponsible to put him straight into a test match   andrew told the times. wilkinson is recovering from a knee injury which followed long-term neck and arm injuries. he has not played for england since the world cup final in november 2003  since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their 14 matches. wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the zurich premiership match against harlequins on 13 march.  that game is the day after england play italy in the six nations and six days before their final match of the championship against scotland.  we are hoping jonny will be ready in a fortnight  but it is touch and go   said andrew.  his recovery is going very well and the key now is how he is reintroduced to playing and with it goal-kicking.  he will probably have to come off the bench to start and it would be ridiculous and irresponsible to put him straight back into a test match.  we can t afford to get it wrong with a knee injury. we are in touch with england and they are relaxed about it.  despite not playing for england  wilkinson is still hoping to make the lions tour to new zealand this summer. lions coach sir clive woodward has not set a deadline for when wilkinson has to start playing again in order to be considered for selection.
warning over windows word files writing a microsoft word document can be a dangerous business  according to document security firm workshare.  up to 75% of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed  a survey by the firm revealed. to make matters worse 90% of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking. the report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding.  sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms  competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers  said andrew pearson  european boss of workshare which commissioned the research.  the efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too   he said. the problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using microsoft word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes. as documents get passed around  worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents. poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits. microsoft  however  does provide an add-on tool for windows pcs that fixes the problem.  the remove hidden data add-in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your microsoft office application   says the instructions on microsoft s website. microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any word document. a tool for apple machines running word is not available. workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that  on average  31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category. often  said mr pearson  this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared.  however  the way that windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved. few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed. the discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if  for instance  those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated. the research revealed that a document s metadata could be substantial as  on average  only 40% of contributors  changes to a document make it to the final draft. problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite  said mr pearson.
christmas sales worst since 1981 uk retail sales fell in december  failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst christmas since 1981.  retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in december  after a 0.6% rise in november  the office for national statistics (ons) said. the ons revised the annual 2004 rate of growth down from the 5.9% estimated in november to 3.2%. a number of retailers have already reported poor figures for december. clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth  according to the ons.  the last time retailers endured a tougher christmas was 23 years previously  when sales plunged 1.7%.  the ons echoed an earlier caution from bank of england governor mervyn king not to read too much into the poor december figures. some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures  pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figures showed a performance comparable with 2003. the november-december jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages  although some way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s. and figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending  an indication that consumers are looking for bargains  and retailers are cutting their prices.  however  reports from some high street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector. morrisons  woolworths  house of fraser  marks & spencer and big food all said that the festive period was disappointing.  and a british retail consortium survey found that christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years. yet  other retailers - including hmv  monsoon  jessops  body shop and tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year. investec chief economist philip shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates.  the retail sales figures are very weak  but as bank of england governor mervyn king indicated last night  you don t really get an accurate impression of christmas trading until about easter   said mr shaw.  our view is the bank of england will keep its powder dry and wait to see the big picture.
snow patrol bassist exits group snow patrol had  no other course of action  but to ask their co-founder and bassist to leave the band  lead singer gary lightbody has said.  mark mcclelland had been in the band for more than 10 years since its formation at dundee university. lightbody said  over the last 18 months touring has taken its toll on the rest of the band s relationship with him . he said:  this is the hardest decision we have ever had to make and believe us when we say we didn t make it lightly.  the group  originally from northern ireland  has only achieved mainstream success in the last year with the single run and award-winning album final straw. in a statement on the band s website  lightbody said:  i started the group with mark 10 years ago and he was a massive part of snow patrol and my life throughout that decade.   he added:  it got to the stage that things couldn t go on as they were  so we felt there was no other course of action but this.  i know you will all be distressed and may not understand this news but we had to do what was best for the band.  snow patrol are currently working on the follow-up to their breakthrough third album. the band is set to play support to u2 on a number of summer stadium gigs. last month  they were the big winners in ireland s top music honours  the meteor awards  picking up accolades for best band and album. it followed nominations for the brit awards and the mercury music prize. the band formed in 1994 when lightbody and mcclelland met as students at dundee university.
tevez - an argentine in brazil some 65 years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil.  he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige - which he failed to live up to. he left an impression  but not for reasons he would have wanted. the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play. even today   gandula  is the term used in brazil for ballboy. brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then  and many will delight now if history is repeated. another boca juniors player is coming to brazil.  the new maradona  - carlos tevez - is joining corinthians for nearly $20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year. corinthians - or the london-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez. it is particularly strange as - until last week - tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil  where the argentine championship is not shown.  presumably there is some financial logic behind the move. what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north  rather than across the atlantic. argentina s brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal. but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez. boca re-signed martin palermo  forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role. and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report - atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be  disorganized.  hounded by the press  tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires. so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of  tranquillity.  anyone acquainted with the city of s&#227;o paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration. brazil s biggest city is a sprawling  ugly  restless metropolis. once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of a city of italian immigrants.  but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers. the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians. it is the most passionately supported club in brazil. pel&#233; scored reams of goals against them  reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own. that passion can also be turned against the team - especially nowadays  when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazil s big cities. corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players. tevez  then  can kiss tranquillity goodbye. he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores  south america s champions league. corinthians have not qualified. indeed  he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match. next year s brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april. until then he will have to make do with the foolish s&#227;o paulo state championship  an appalling waste of his talent. there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina. like so many of the top south american players  tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left  to pass when he was expected to dribble  to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares. but his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all.
spears seeks aborted tour payment singer britney spears is suing eight insurance companies that have refused to reimburse her for cancelling her 2004 world tour.  the pop star cancelled her onyx hotel tour last june after suffering a knee injury during a video shoot. she is now seeking to be reimbursed for the tour s £5m ($9.3m) costs in a claim filed at new york state supreme court. seven london-based companies and an eighth paris firm have been given up to 30 days to respond to the complaint.  the 22-year-old star initially missed a number of shows on the 82-date tour after injuring her knee during a show in illinois last march. but she was rushed to hospital and needed surgery after a later incident while filming a video for her song outrageous  leading her to cancel the rest of the tour  including dates in china.  she obviously took a wrong step and blew out her knee   a jive spokeswoman said at the time.  it was an old dance injury.  the legal submission described spears as  one of the most recognised performers in her industry . the onyx hotel tour was cited as  a highly crafted production which included the well-known music and dancing of spears  supported by elaborate costumes  complex choreography as well as cutting-edge video production  lighting and other effects . in september spears married kevin federline  who had been a dancer on the aborted tour.

bosvelt optimistic over new deal manchester city s paul bosvelt will find out  within a month  whether he is to be offered a new one-year deal.  the 34-year-old dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and  although his age may count against him  he feels he can play on for another season.  i told the club i would like to stay for one more year. they promised me an answer within the next month so i am waiting to see   he said.  the main concern is my age but i think i have proved i am fit enough. bosvelt joined city from feyenoord in 2003 and at first he struggled to adapt to life in england. but his professionalism and dedication impressed manager kevin keegan.  he realised the pace of the game was faster than anything he was used to but he drove himself back into the team. he is an unsung hero   said keegan.
castaignede fires laporte warning former france fly-half thomas castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach bernard laporte following their defeat by wales.  france suffered a shock loss against the welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win. castaignede told bbc sport:  the pressure is big on laporte after a huge loss to new zealand  a slim win over scotland and a miracle against england.  but the french have to get behind him and the team at lansdowne road.  following victories over south africa and australia in november  france were deemed by many to be the world s leading side. but they were then trounced 45-6 by new zealand and only just beat scotland after the scots had a try disallowed in their six nations opener. it then took some woeful spot kicking from charlie hodgson and olly barkley to help them to victory against england at twickenham. &lt;  castaignede said:  you can t say any of those results have eased the pressure on laporte.  had england s kickers not been so bad  the position in the six nations would be very different now.  laporte has been criticised for france s negative tactics in their wins over scotland and england. but his side played a more free-flowing style against wales  making a mockery of the opposition s defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval.  all the chat in france has been about how france will play against ireland   said castaignede ahead of the 12 march tie.  everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against wales. but everyone also wants a win.  castaignede  a veteran of 43 international caps  admitted the french would go in as underdogs against ireland.   going to ireland is never easy but the way they re playing right now  it s harder than ever   said castaignede.  they re very experienced and don t often lose at home. they ve got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break.  despite praising the irish he claimed the welsh had the upper hand in the six nations run-in.  ireland have such a good pack but wales are something else on the break   he added.  at the weekend they were simply awesome. as a frenchman it was disappointing to see  but you had to admire it.  their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship.  the 30-year-old also tipped yann delaigue to start ahead of frederic michalak at number 10 after an impressive display in paris last weekend.  delaigue played really well and admittedly michalak played well too   said castaignede.  i m just glad i m not the one who has to make the decision.
lifestyle  governs mobile choice  faster  better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets  research suggests.  instead  phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size  onboard memory or the chip inside  shows an in-depth study by handset maker ericsson.  historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology   said dr michael bjorn  senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson s consumer and enterprise lab.  we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives   he said.  we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing   he told the bbc news website.  for the study  ericsson interviewed 14 000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone.  people s habits remain the same   said dr bjorn.  they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it s a much more convenient way to do it.   one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people  he said. while diaries have always been popular  a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. youngsters  use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it  the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. ericsson s research has shown that consumers divide into different  tribes  that use phones in different ways. dr bjorn said groups dubbed  pioneers  and  materialists  were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use.  for instance   he said   older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago.  this was because younger users  often the children of ageing mobile owners  encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.  another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them  such as cameras  can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.  once this significant number of users is passed  use of new innovations tends to take off. dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. however  he said  now 45% of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. in 2003 the figure was 29%. similarly  across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. in 2003 only 4% of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month. now the figure is 14%. similar rises have been seen in many other european nations. dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras.  usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras   he said. digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings  holidays and birthdays. by contrast  he said  camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.
commodore finds new lease of life the once-famous commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a us-based digital music distributor.  new owner yeahronimo media ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of commodore computers. it also plans to develop a  worldwide entertainment concept  with the brand  although details are not yet known. the groundbreaking commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.  in the chronology of home computing  commodore was one of the pioneers.  the commodore 64  launched in 1982  was one of the first affordable home pcs. it was followed a few years later by the amiga. the commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system  even to this day. the brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. commodore international filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to dutch firm tulip computers. in the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to atari  which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games  formerly known as infogrames.  tulip computers sold several products under the commodore name  including portable usb storage devices and digital music players. it had planned to relaunch the brand  following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for windows pc  apple mac and even pdas so that the original commodore games can be still run. the sale of commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.
petrol duties frozen  brown says chancellor gordon brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the commons on thursday.  mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments. but this financial year  because of  volatility in the oil market   he said the duty would be frozen. during 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution. he said:  it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services.  but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties.   the rac welcomed the news  calling it an  early christmas present  for motorists. but the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol. environmental group transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists.  we are concerned that although britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action   said a spokesman. in 2000 the people s fuel lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slow-moving convoys after mr brown threatened to raise fuel taxes. the chancellor did not raise duty that year  but despite threats of more protests in 2003  he added 1.28p per litre.
sydney to host north v south game sydney will host a northern versus southern hemisphere charity match in june or july  the australian rugby union (aru) said on wednesday.  the match will include players from the lions tour of new zealand.  the australian rugby union has thrown its support behind a proposed north-south match to raise funds for the tsunami appeals   the aru said. the date is yet to be decided but the most likely venue is sydney s olympic stadium. aru chief executive gary flowers said the world cricket charity match in melbourne earlier this month had inspired the aru.  we still need to discuss the options with the irb (international rugby board)  the lions and our sanzar (south africa  new zealand and australia rugby) partners  but june or july is seen as a better option than march to ensure we have the cream of southern hemisphere rugby available   he said. wallabies captain george gregan said the charity match was a  great initiative . tri-nations rivals australia  new zealand and south africa would feature prominently in a southern team against a northern side comprised of six nations teams france  ireland  england  wales  italy and scotland. coach clive woodward s lions squad will tour new zealand in june and july  including tests on 25 june  2 and 9 july.  almost 80 000 fans packed into melbourne cricket ground on 10 january for a charity match that raised £5.9m for victims of the asian tsunami.

iranian mps threaten mobile deal turkey s biggest private mobile firm could bail out of a $3bn ($1.6bn) deal to build a network in iran after mps there slashed its stake in the project.  conservatives in parliament say turkcell s stake in irancell  the new network  should be cut from 70% to 49%. they have already given themselves a veto over all foreign investment deals  following allegations about turkish firms  involvement in israel. turkcell now says it may give up on the deal altogether.  iran currently has only one heavily congested mobile network  with long waiting lists for new subscribers. turkcell signed a contract for the new network in september. the new operator planned to offer subscriptions for about $180  well below the existing firm s $500 price tag. but a parliamentary commission has now ruled that turkcell s 70% controlling stake is too high. they say that turkcell is a security risk because of alleged business ties with israel. parliament as a whole - dominated by religious conservatives - will vote on the ruling on tuesday.  turkcell said the ruling would  make more difficult... turkcell s financial consolidation of irancell  because its stake would be reduced to less than 50%.  if management control and financial consolidation of irancell cannot be achieved... the realisation of the project will become risky   it warned in a statement. the firm has refused to comment on whether it has business dealings in israel  although like almost all gsm operators worldwide it has an interconnection deal with israeli networks so that its customers can use their phones there. the two countries strengthened ties in both defence and economic issues in 2004. israeli industry minister ehud olmert was reported in june to have attended a meeting between ruhi dogusoy  turkcell s chief operating officer  and executives from israeli telecoms firms. telecoms is one of two areas specifically targeted by the new veto law on foreign investments  passed earlier in september. the other is airports  a source of controversy after the army closed tehran s new imam khomeini international airport on its opening day in may 2004. again  the allegation was that the part-turkish tav consortium which built and ran it had links with israel.
bmw cash to fuel mini production less than four years after the new mini was launched  german car maker bmw has announced £100m of new investment.  some 200 new jobs are to be created at the oxford factory  including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. the result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200 000 cars from 2007. the rise  from 189 000 last year  is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. before wednesday s announcement  bmw had invested some £280m in mini production.  since its launch during summer 2001  the new mini has gone from strength to strength.  last year  almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini. the company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry.  our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away   said norbert reithofer  a member of the bmw management board. initially  bmw said it would produce 100 000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford  but the target was quickly reached  then raised  time and time again. not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue.  the risk is that after they ve invested massively in the brand  demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle   said brad wernle  from automotive news europe.  the price of the car has also gone up. when it was launched  the cheapest mini cost just more than £10 000. these days  buyers will have to fork out almost £11 500 to own a new mini one  or even more for the cooper s which costs up to £17 730. the mini convertible  which was launched last spring  costs up to £15 690 for the top model  and there is even a waiting list. second-hand minis are not cheap either. a mini one bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least £8 000 for the cheapest model  while a used cooper s is likely to be priced from £12 556  according to the-car buying website parker s. the consumers  association which operates with slightly different numbers  yet it confirms that the mini cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car  other than the mercedes benz c180 se and the bmw 1 series 116i se.  the cowley factory  which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100 000 minis  is increasingly being put to good use.  there are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. bmw s mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the phoenix consortium. in 1999  when bmw still owned rover  the oxford factory was producing the award-winning rover 75. during that year  3 500 people produced 56 000 cars. last year  in the same factory  almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4 500 mini-workers. the mini factory s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge  which in 1999 produced 180 000 rover cars. last year  mg rover  which employs more than 6 000 people  produced just 110 000 cars  though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation (saic) that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge. indeed  mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers (which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford) are taken into account.
winter freeze keeps oil above $50 oil prices carried on rising on wednesday after cold weather on both sides of the north atlantic pushed us crude prices to four-month highs.  freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls took crude oil prices past $50 a barrel on tuesday for the first time since november. declines in the dollar have also contributed to the rising oil price. us crude was trading at $51.39 at 0710 gmt in asian electronic trade on wednesday. a barrel of us crude oil closed up $2.80 at $51.15 in new york on tuesday. opec members said on tuesday that  given such high prices  the cartel saw no reason to cut its output.  although below last year s peak of $55.67 a barrel  which was reached in october  prices are now well above 2004 s average of $41.48. brent crude also rose in london trading  adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close.  much of western europe and the north east of america has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. the decline in the us dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices.  the primary factor is the weak dollar   said victor shum  a singapore-based analyst with purvin and gertz. expectations that a rebound in the dollar would halt the oil price rise were not immediately borne out on wednesday morning  as oil prices carried on upwards as the dollar strengthened against the euro  the pound and the yen.  several opec members said on tuesday that a cut in production was unlikely  citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from asia.  i agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this   fathi bin shatwan  libya s oil minister  told reuters.  i do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel   he added.
could yukos be a blessing in disguise  other things being equal  the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business.  but in the looking-glass world of modern russia  the opposite might just be true  a new report* has argued. the study  from the centre for economic policy research  does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos. but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms  even targets of the tax police.  an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive  even accounting for increased levels of taxation   the authors say.  the paper s reasoning is complex  and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular  the propensity of management to steal from the company. the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal  since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. in the west  meanwhile  higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. on the other hand  increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent  forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. the net result  the authors say  is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.  after vladimir putin became president in 2000  he did not raise taxes  but put a lot of effort - too much  critics argue - into enforcement.  since then  the russian stock market has more than trebled in value  a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. the report highlights the case of sibneft  a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year. after mr putin came to power  the company s overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%  and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. but shareholders benefited hugely: sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. according to the authors  although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time  the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers.  does this analysis make sense  in part  certainly. for all its faults  corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. foreign direct investment  long negligible  is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe. but the authors  model does not quite cover all the complexities. for a start  the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit  governments want to maximise tax revenue. in fact  the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. companies can  for example  persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.  and the authors  definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western. genuine  disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. the case against yukos  for example  has moved in fits and starts  with little clarity from the government about its intentions  and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. as far as most commentators are concerned  the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta  rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. since yukos  founder  mikhail khodorkovsky  was arrested a year ago  the russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.
minister hits out at yukos sale russia s renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed  a senior government figure has warned.  economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was  unjustified . his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm s assets into public ownership. on 28 december  another senior economic adviser called the sale  the swindle of the century . yuganskneftegaz  the unit which produced 60% of yukos  output  had been seized and sold in december for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called baikal.  baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm rosneft  itself shortly to merge with state gas giant gazprom.  we used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing   andrei illarionov - then economic adviser to president vladimir putin - told a press conference.  now officials are doing it.  within days  he was stripped of most of his responsibilities.  mr gref  a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market  was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronov s comments. the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled  he said. but he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil.  i think that rosneft and yuganskneftegaz  should it become a state-owned company  must be privatized   he said.   today our government is ineffective and state companies  as a result  are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well.  and he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like yukos - a technique now being applied by the kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake.  if we follow that logic  we should nationalise all businesses   he said. many large russian companies  particularly in the energy sector  use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes.  mr gref also poured cold water on president putin s promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. the assault on yukos  assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months.  the task is not simply to double gdp; instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve people s lives   mr gref told kommersant.  we don t need simply to increase gdp  but to improve its structure.  instead of focusing on headline growth figures  russia needed to focus on better institutions  such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.
abbas  will not tolerate  attacks palestinian leader mahmoud abbas has said he will not tolerate attacks such as last friday s suicide bombing in the israeli city of tel aviv.  in an interview ahead of a meeting in london to discuss palestinian reforms  mr abbas said such attacks were against palestinian interests. the palestinian authority (pa) was exerting  a 100% effort  to end the violence  mr abbas added. the attack  which killed five  was the first of its kind since he took office. mr abbas confirmed israel shared information with the pa in the hunt for the organisers of the attack. the israeli government refuses to accept syria s denials that it was implicated in the nightclub bombing. israeli officials gave an intelligence briefing to foreign ambassadors on monday  explaining syria s alleged involvement. british foreign minister jack straw said there had been a  continuing stream  of information suggesting palestinian militant groups were operating from within syria.  in an email interview in the british newspaper the independent  mr abbas said:  we believe peace is possible now and we are ready to negotiate with israel to reach a true and lasting peace based on justice and international legitimacy.  he added:  we have an opportunity and it would be irresponsible if we  the israelis  or the world allow it to slip away.  tuesday s meeting on palestinian reform is being hosted by british prime minister tony blair. also due to attend are us secretary of state condoleezza rice  un secretary general kofi annan  world bank officials and foreign ministers from 23 european and arab countries. the conference was a  vital step  in renewing the peace process  mr straw said.  it s a high-level attendance  which reflects the sense of momentum and opportunity created by recent events   he added. a spokesman for mr blair said the prime minister expected the conference to discuss  a comprehensive  co-ordinated and  above all  practical work plan for both the palestinian authority and the international community . israel will not attend  but is said to be closely watching the outcome.
uk broadband gets speed injection broadband s rapid rise continues apace as speeds gear up a notch.  an eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider uk online. it is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband tv. the service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use bt s exchanges and will initially only be available in towns.  it represents a  big leap forward  for broadband  said chris stening  uk online general manager.  the service comes with a hefty £39.99 monthly price tag but will mean users can download mp3s in seconds and offers tv-quality video streaming. the service includes wifi as standard  meaning users can connect multiple pcs  laptops and game consoles from any room in the house. not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service  as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas. the service will initially be available to users within 2km radius of 230 telephone exchanges in areas such as london  birmingham  glasgow and cambridge. that represents about 4.4 million households. the service is possible due to a decision to loosen bt s strangle-hold on telephone exchanges.  the process  known as local loop unbundling  was put in motion by the now defunct telecoms watchdog oftel but has only proved popular in recent months due to falling costs. uk online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls  video-on-demand and tv by 2005 if the service proves popular.  the service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the uk and 16 times faster than most broadband services   said mr stening.  it takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it   he said. countries such as south korea and france have found the advantage of upping the speeds of broadband. in south korea  video-on-demand over the net is cheaper than renting a dvd and online gaming is huge. mr stening believes the service will appeal to people in multi-occupancy buildings as well as easing family arguments.  a typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a 512 kilobit service. this will basically give them 2 megabits each   he said.
broadband set to revolutionise tv bt is starting its push into television with plans to offer tv over broadband.  as a telecoms company  bt is moving to a content distribution strategy  andrew burke  chief of bt s new entertainment unit told the iptv world forum.  we want to be an entertainment facilitator   he said on the opening day of the london conference. the bbc is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to non-licence fee payers overseas. the corporation s interactive media player (imp) is its first foray into broadband tv - known as iptv (internet protocol tv).   we see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers   said bt s andrew burke.  with more people on broadband  and connection speeds increasing  telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it. increased competition between net service providers  encouraged by ofcom  has eroded bt s position in the market. it is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over adsl a reality. it also sees delivering tv over broadband as a way of getting high-definition (hd) content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional  regular broadcasts. the bbc s imp has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in 2005. before it officially launches  the bbc must show the government how it offers value for money. delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value  says the bbc  because it gives people more control  and more choice.  iptv is a similar idea to voip services  like skype. both use broadband net connections to carry information  like video and voice  in packets of data instead of conventional means. since it uses internet technology  iptv could mean more choice of programmes  more  more interactivity  tailored programming  and more localised content outside of conventional satellite  digital cable  and terrestrial broadcasts.  it is all part of the larger changing tv technology landscape and  like personal digital video recorders (pvrs)  gives people much more control over tv. broadcasters see iptv and pvrs as both as a threat and an opportunity. the bbc recognises that tv over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it  said rahul chakkara  controller of bbci s 24/7 interactive tv services. the imp is based on peer-to-peer technology  and lets people download programmes the bbc owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast.  iptv enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times   said mr chakkara.   so we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for [via the licence fee]  they can access it any time they want.  it helps  said mr burke  that people are more au fait with terms like  digital    interactive   now that digital tv reaches more than 56% of uk homes. according to benoit joly from broadband telecoms firm thales  30% of europe cannot get satellite tv or digital tv. they could get iptv though. analysts say that iptv will account for 10% of the digital tv market in europe alone by the end of the decade. what needs to happen now  agree analysts  is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service; 20mbps connections would be ideal. bt does not see itself as a broadcaster of iptv services  rather as an  enabler   said mr burke. its strategy is a  hybrid  approach  he explained  where over-the-air conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband.  initially appealing to niche markets  like sports fans  it will widen out. but iptv could be used for home-monitoring   pet cams   localised news services  and local authority tv  too says bt. it even suggests that it could target those households in the uk that do not own a computer  40% of the country.  broadband to them would not be about data and the net - that could come later for them - but about cheap phone calls and more choice of tv programmes. home choice already offers 10 000 hours of shows and channels  delivered over broadband to homes in london. with a broadband net subscription  you can also get your tv and phone service. through content deals and partnerships  it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels  and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues. it aims to expand nationally  but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its 15 000 subscribers now  and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer. although still at a very early stage  iptv is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network - another utility like electricity.
beijingers fume over parking fees choking traffic jams in beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges.  car ownership has risen fast in recent years  and there are now two and a half million cars on the city s roads. the trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks  making motorists reluctant to use them. instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option.  the price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable   said wang yan  an official from the beijing municipal commission for development and reform quoted in the state-run china daily newspaper. mr wang  who is in charge of collecting car parking fees  said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.  sports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission s road rage. it wants them to use public transport  and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. mr wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. indoor parking may be costly  but it is not always secure. mr wang s team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; £26). the beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries  motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic. unclogging beijing s increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the chinese authorities  who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 olympic games.
rover deal  may cost 2 000 jobs  some 2 000 jobs at mg rover s midlands plant may be cut if investment in the firm by a chinese car maker goes ahead  the financial times has reported.  shanghai automotive industry corp plans to shift production of the rover 25 to china and export it to the uk  sources close to the negotiations tell the ft. but rover told bbc news that reports of job cuts were  speculation . a tie-up  seen as rover s last chance to save its longbridge plant  has been pushed by uk chancellor gordon brown. rover confirmed the tie-up would take place  not very far away from this time .  rover bosses have said they are  confident  the £1bn ($1.9bn) investment deal would be signed in march or early april.  transport & general worker s union general secretary tony woodley repeated his view on friday that all mergers led to some job cuts. he said investment in new models was needed to ensure the future of the birmingham plant.  this is a very crucial and delicate time and our efforts are targeted to securing new models for the company which will mean jobs for our people   he said. saic says none of its money will be paid to the four owners of rover  who have been accused by unions of awarding themselves exorbitant salaries  the ft reports.  saic is extremely concerned to ensure that its money is used to invest in the business rather than be distributed to the shareholders   the newspaper quotes a source close to the chinese firm. meanwhile  according to chinese state press reports  small state-owned carmaker nanjing auto is in negotiations with rover and saic to take a 20% stake in the joint venture. saic was unavailable for comment on the job cuts when contacted by bbc news. rover and saic signed a technology-sharing agreement in august.
lib dems  to target stamp duty  the liberal democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election  in a bid to court first-time house buyers.  vince cable  the party s treasury spokesman  said raising the threshold to £150 000 would prevent over 400 000 home-buyers from paying the tax. he said first-time buyers were being  squeezed out  of the housing market. the labour party said the liberal democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan. the plan forms part of a wider lib dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market.  under the proposals  the average saving for a new buyer would be more than £1 000  according to mr cable.  first time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net   he said.  by failing to uprate the stamp duty threshold gordon brown has hit first time buyers and those on low incomes the hardest.  by pledging to increase the threshold to £150 000  the liberal democrats will make it possible for many first time buyers to buy a property without facing this tax.  paul boateng mp  labour s chief secretary to the treasury  said:  the lib dems  sums don t add up.  they can have no credibility until they can say how they would fund their ever growing list of tax and spending commitments.  mr cable will publish his  alternative budget  on monday.
how to smash a home computer an executive who froze his broken hard disk thinking it would be fixed has topped a list of the weirdest computer mishaps.  although computer malfunctions remain the most common cause of file loss  data recovery experts say human behaviour still is to blame in many cases. they say that no matter how effective technology is at rescuing files  users should take more time to back-up and protect important files. the list of the top 10 global data disasters was compiled by recovery company ontrack.  careless - and preventable - mistakes that result in data loss range from reckless file maintenance practices to episodes of pure rage towards a computer. this last category includes the case of a man who became so mad with his malfunctioning laptop that he threw it in the lavatory and flushed a couple of times.  data can disappear as a result of natural disaster  system fault or computer virus  but human error  including  computer rage   seems to be a growing problem   said adrian palmer  managing director of ontrack data recovery.   nevertheless  victims soon calm down when they realise the damage they ve done and come to us with pleas for help to retrieve their valuable information.  a far more common situation is when a computer virus strikes and leads to precious files being corrupted or deleted entirely. mr palmer recalled the case of a couple who had hundreds of pictures of their baby s first three months on their computer  but managed to reformat the hard drive and erase all the precious memories.  data can be recovered from computers  servers and even memory cards used in digital devices in most cases   said mr palmer.  however  individuals and companies can avoid the hassle and stress this can cause by backing up data on a regular basis.
russia wto talks  make progress  talks on russia s proposed membership of the world trade organisation (wto) have been  making good progress  say those behind the negotiations.  but the chairman of the working party  ambassador stefan johannesson of iceland  warned that there was  still a lot of work has to be done . his comments came as president george w bush said the us backed russian entry. but he said for russia to make progress the government must  renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . his comments come three days before he is due to meet president vladimir putin.  russia has been waiting for a decade to join the wto and hopes to finally become a member by early 2006. a decision could be reached in december  when the wto s 148 current members gather for a summit in hong kong. that would allow an earliest date for membership of january 2006  if the hong kong summit gave its approval. while pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with russia  the us said the meeting was  much more efficient than we ve seen for some time . and australia said it was  one of the best (meetings) we can recall in terms of substance . mr johannesson also said progress  on the bilateral market access side is accelerating . sticking points to membership have included limits on foreign ownership in the telecommunications and life insurance businesses  as well as issues surrounding counterfeiting  piracy  and data protection. some wto members also dislike russia s energy price subsidies  which competitors say give russian businesses an unfair advantage.
bt offers free net phone calls bt is offering customers free internet telephone calls if they sign up to broadband in december.  the christmas give-away entitles customers to free telephone calls anywhere in the uk via the internet. users will need to use bt s internet telephony software  known as bt communicator  and have a microphone and speakers or headset on their pc. bt has launched the promotion to show off the potential of a broadband connection to customers.  people wanting to take advantage of the offer will need to be a bt together fixed-line customer and will have to sign up to broadband online. the offer will be limited to the first 50 000 people who sign up and there are limitations - the free calls do not include calls to mobiles  non-geographical numbers such as 0870  premium numbers or international numbers. bt is keen to provide extra services to its broadband customers.  people already using bt communicator have found it by far the most convenient way of making a call if they are at their pc   said andrew burke  director of value-added services at bt retail. as more homes get high-speed access  providers are increasingly offering add-ons such as cheap net calls.  broadband and telephony are attractive to customers and bt wants to make sure it is in the first wave of services   said ian fogg  an analyst with jupiter research.  bt communicator had a quiet launch in the summer and now bt is waving the flag a bit more for it   he added.  bt has struggled to maintain its market share of broadband subscribers as more competitors enter the market. reports say that bt has lost around 10% of market share over the last year  down from half of broadband users to less than 40%. bt is hoping its latest offer can persuade more people to jump on the broadband bandwagon. it currently has 1.3 million broadband subscribers.
sella wants michalak recall former france centre philippe sella believes coach bernard laporte must recall frederic michalak to give his side any chance of beating ireland.  sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half yann delaigue in the rbs six nations to date. but he told bbc sport:  michalak is the answer both now and for the future. delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back michalak.  he does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset ireland.  the 22-year-old michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after delaigue impressed for castres early in the season. with michalak overlooked  the french stuttered to narrow wins over scotland and then england before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to wales.  the wales game was amazing to watch but never did i think the french could lose that game at half-time   said sella.   their only mistakes were that they didn t score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second... but only a little bit.  sella  however  insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire laporte  despite the defeat at the stade de france.  this season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 world cup   said sella   which laporte is doing very well. the french get better every game.  it s difficult  though  when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel.  but he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to world cup victory.  as a result  it is important that people give him time. it may not seem good now that we re not winning the grand slam but no one will care in two years time if we re world champions.   the majority of media criticism centred on the way in which france produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games. but while sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against wales  he said  the win was most important .  winning is all that matters   he added.  ok  the flair may not have been so good  but the discipline  organisation and defence was there  which are all important ahead of 2007.  france play what sella believes is their hardest game of the six nations against ireland in dublin on saturday 12 march. the french go into the game as clear underdogs. but sella added:  people forget that france can still win the six nations and they ll be focused on that.  but ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd. it s going to be tough.
downloads enter us singles chart digital music downloads are being included in the main us singles chart for the first time.  billboard s hot 100 chart now incorporates data from sales of music downloads  previously only assigned to a separate download chart. green day s boulevard of broken dreams is currently number two in billboard s pop chart  and tops its digital chart. download sales are due to be incorporated into the uk singles chart later this year.  digital sales in the us are already used to compile billboard s hot digital sales chart. they will now be tallied with sales of physical singles and airplay information to make up its new hot 100 chart. its second new chart - the pop 100 - also combines airplay  digital and physical sales but confines its airplay information to us radio stations which play chart music. in addition to green day  other artists in the current us digital sales top 10 include kelly clarkson  the game and the killers.  sales of legally downloaded songs shot up more than tenfold in 2004  with 200 million track purchased online in the us and europe in 12 months  the international federation of the phonographic industry (ifpi) reported last month. in the uk sales of song downloads overtook those for physical singles for the first time at the end of last year. the last week of december 2004 saw download sales of 312 000 compared with 282 000 physical singles  according to the british phonographic industry. the uk s first official music download chart was launched last september  compiling the most popular tracks downloaded from legal uk sites - including itunes  od2  mycokemusic.com and napster. westlife s flying without wings - a 1999 track reissued for the occasion - was the first number one of the uk download chart.  a spokesman for the british phonographic industry (bpi) said the first combined uk download and sales chart was due to be compiled  within the first half of this year .  work is going on across the music business right now to make sure the new chart works to plan   he said. the bpi spokesman described the uk music download chart  compiled by the official charts company  as having been  a great success  since its launch.  it has provided a focus for the industry and has really driven interest in downloads among music fans   he said.
be careful how you code a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action  warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson.  if it gets its way  the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament  lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. if the new law was about border controls  defence or even the new constitution  then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. sadly for those who will be directly affected  the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs  a topic that may excite the bloggers  campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain. after all  how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions  and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention  yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu s ministerial councils  as seems likely  it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us. many observers of the computing scene  including myself  think the results will be disastrous for small companies  innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors  use of really obvious ideas.  in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless amazon lets you  because they hold the patent on  one-click  online purchase. it is a small invention  but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it.  we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here  but perhaps not for long. the new proposals go back to 2002  although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s. they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made  endorsed by the council of ministers  radically modified by the european parliament and then re-presented in their original form. some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. poland has rejected the proposal and germany s main political parties have opposed it  but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position  but according to those present  it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned.  the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an  a  item and can only be approved or rejected. no discussion or amendment is allowed. so why should we be worried  first  there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. this goes to the heart of the european project  and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. if coders are treated like this today  who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow   more directly  once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else s patent. this is not about stealing software  as code is already protected by copyright. patents are not copyright  but something much stronger. a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention  even if the other person invented it separately. i have never  to my shame  managed to read lord byron s childe harold s pilgrimage. if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence. the same does not hold for a patent. if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files  then i am in trouble under patent law  at least in the us. coincidence is no defence. the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies  but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. they have legal departments and  more crucially  patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders.  even this system breaks down  of course  as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer (and other browsers) infringed an eolas patent. that one was eventually thrown out  but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. but small companies  and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. much of the really useful software we use every day  programs like the apache web server  the gnu/linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser  is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. the damage to software will not happen overnight  of course. if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly  probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. and it will damage europe s computer industry. we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.
labour trio  had vote-rig factory  three labour councillors in birmingham were caught operating a  vote-rigging factory   an election court has heard.  police found the trio handling unsealed postal ballots in a deserted warehouse in the city during a late-night raid in june 2004  the hearing was told. the votes were later counted towards that month s english local elections. the men  elected to the aston ward  deny collecting votes fraudulently. the judge presiding has indicated the whole postal voting system is under scrutiny. deputy high court judge richard mawrey  qc told the hearing at the birmingham and midlands institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming general election.  the special election court  the first in living memory to hear allegations of vote-rigging  opened in birmingham last month. the case against muhammad afzal  mohammed islam and mohammed kazi is being brought by local liberal democrat supporters. they claim the trio benefited from the widespread misuse of postal votes during the 10 june election. ravi sukul  counsel for the petitioners  accused the three men of being  deeply involved  in illegal practices. witnesses saw them carrying several bags from their campaign office  which the men drove to a warehouse on an industrial estate off birch road east  the court was told.  the police were alerted and called to the premises. mr sukul said:  when (the officers) arrived there  in the middle of the night  they saw a large room with a 10ft long table and six asian men present.  hundreds of documents and unsealed envelopes were scattered all over the table.  the police officers left the warehouse  but were later ordered back to seize the documents.  when the officers left  all the envelopes and papers were scattered   mr sukul said.   (when they went) back to make the seizure  every one of these 275 yellow ballot papers were placed neatly in envelope a and sealed. the house was in order.  interrupting mr sukul in his opening  mr mawrey said:  what you are saying is  these men were operating a vote-forging factory on an industrial estate.  the court heard how documents were taken by police to the elections office next morning  where they were mixed in with other ballots. the case against the men follows a hearing into postal fraud allegations made against three other birmingham councillors in the bordesley green ward  claims which are denied. mr mawrey is due to deliver a judgment in their case once the aston petition has been heard. mr afzal  mr islam and mr kazi deny conspiring to commit election fraud to deceive the returning officer. the case continues.
paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday s epic in paris   and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978  those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris. welsh legend mervyn davies  a member of two of three grand slam-winning sides of the 1970s  hailed it as  one of the great performances of the past three decades . martyn williams  wales  two-try scorer on the day  called it  one of the most surreal games i have ever played in . a crestfallen france coach  bernard laporte  simply observed:  there was a french half and there was a welsh half . and what a half it was for the red dragonhood  transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. but while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure  the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this welsh side. that they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time  then reverse it on the resumption  was remarkable enough. but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes  wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.  in international rugby  any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day  but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory  the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. ten of the 22 on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced 33-5 in paris two years ago. but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the 2003 world cup  wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.   the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class   noted coach mike ruddock. the likes of michael owen  gethin jenkins  dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer s lions tour to new zealand. and players like stephen jones  martyn williams  shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. jones  after his superb man-of-the-match display  observed that  we are a very happy camp now . ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that  ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. the  joie de vivre  so evident in that magical second-half spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.  if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship  they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. similarly  wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches  and that forward power  mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. so on to murrayfield  where wales have not won on their last three visits. while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive  the players will set about the task of beating scotland. only then - with the visit of ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s  and writing their own names into welsh legend.
loyalty cards idea for tv addicts viewers could soon be rewarded for watching tv as loyalty cards come to a screen near you.  any household hooked up to sky could soon be using smartcards in conjunction with their set-top boxes. broadcasters such as sky and itv could offer viewers loyalty points in return for watching a particular channel or programme. sky will activate a spare slot on set-top boxes in january  marketing magazine new media age reported.  sky set-top boxes have two slots. one is for the viewer s decryption card  while the other has been dormant until now.  loyalty cards have become a common addition to most wallets  as high street brands rush to keep customers with a series of incentives offered by store cards. now similar schemes look set to enter the highly competitive world of multi-channel tv. viewers who stay loyal to a particular tv channel could be rewarded by free tv content or freebies from retail partners. broadcasters aiming content at children could offer smartcards which gives membership to exclusive content and clubs.  parents could pre-pay for some content  as a kind of tv pocket money card   said nigel whalley  managing director of media consultancy decipher.  viewers could even be rewarded for watching ad breaks  with ideas such as ad bingo being touted by firms keen to make money out of the new market  said mr whalley. credit cards that have been chipped could be used in set-top boxes to pay for movies  gambling and gaming.  the idea of an intelligent card in boxes offers a lot of possibilities. it will be down to the ingenuity of the content players   said mr whalley. for the bbc  revenue-generating activity will be of little interest but the new development may prompt changes to freeview set-top boxes  said mr whalley. currently most freeview boxes do not have a slot which would allow viewers to use a smartcard. some 7.4 million households have sky boxes and sky is hoping to increase this to 10 million by 2010. loyalty cards could play a role in this  particularly in reducing the number of people who cancel their sky subscriptions  said ian fogg  an analyst with jupiter research.
tech helps disabled speed demons an organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport  which is now increasingly possible thanks to technological innovations.  the motorsport endeavour club left the starting grid yesterday at the autosport international 2005 show at birmingham s nec  with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display.  motorcycle racer  roy tansley  from derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated.  i needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg   mr tansley told the bbc news website.  in simple terms  i needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a heath robinson device.  mr tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing s governing body  the autocycle union.  at that time they wouldn t let any amputee race at all  but eventually they told me i could have a licence as long as i raced sidecars.  mr tansley s invention  the pro-shift  is designed to work with hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing. in addition to helping disabled riders to compete  mr tansley reckons that the pro-shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the isle of man tt. as a result  there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance.  i m not prejudiced  i ll sell to able-bodied people if i have to!  he joked.  another exhibit on the motorsport endeavour stand is a subaru impreza rally car  adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. the vehicle belongs to pararallying  the world s only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in lincolnshire.   we use the latest technology supplied by an italian company   said rally driver dave hawkins who runs the company.  the cars have electronic throttles  electronic brakes  electronic clutches - we ve yet to turn anybody away.  mr hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees  quadriplegics  people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated. pararallying uses a vauxhall astra gsi with an automatic gearbox and manual subaru imprezas. the car on display is fitted with a  duck clutch  - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. it also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar.  when joy rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father  murray  is a former australian formula 3 champion.  and it was rainey senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter s small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs. she uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals  a cushion behind her back and raising the seat.  but in a competition car you have to have everything right or you ll lose the balance of the car   she said.  i bring everything back to me - steering wheel  steering column  gear lever and pedals.  when she recently took part in the london to sydney marathon she shared the driving with her partner  trevor  who now does the engineering work. he designed a system for their morris minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute. the motorsport endeavour club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level.
tv s future down the phone line internet tv has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now.  but any early attempts to do it - the uk s home choice started in 1992 - were thwarted by the lack of a fast network. now that broadband networks are bedding down  and it is becoming essential for millions  the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line. in the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls  they are keen to be the top iptv dogs. software giant microsoft thinks iptv - internet protocol tv - is the future of television  and it sits neatly with its vision of the  connected entertainment experience .  telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time   ed graczyk  director of marketing for microsoft iptv  told the bbc news website.  the challenge has been the broadband network  and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution.  compression technology was not efficient enough  the net was not good enough. a lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality.   last year  he said  was all about deal making and partnering up; shaping the  iptv ecosystem . this year  those deals will start to play out and more services will come online.  2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in south america  and other parts of asia  it will expand   he added. what telcos really want to do is to send the  triple-play  of video  voice  and data down one single line  be it cable or dsl (digital subscriber line). some are talking about  quadruple play   too  with mobile services added into the mix. it is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators. according to technology analysts  tdg research  there will be 20 million subscribers to iptv services in under six years.  key to the appeal of sending tv programmes down the same line as the web data  whenever a viewer wants it  is that it uses the same technology as the internet. it means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the  broadcaster . this allows for more dvd-like interactivity  limitless storage and broadcast space  bespoke channel  playlists   and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer s fingertips. it potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller  niche or localised audiences  sending films to bollywood fans for instance  as well as individual devices.  operators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer  bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver. perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking. currently  there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite  cable or freeview. with iptv  the speed is 15 milliseconds.  that gets rounds of applause   according to mr graczyk. microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about iptv some time ago.  we believe this will be the way all tv is delivered in the future - but that is several years away   said mr graczyk.  as with music  tv has moved to digital formats.  the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv  to the mobile  to the gaming console and so on.  the company intends its microsoft s iptv edition software  an end-to-end management and delivery platform  to let telcos to do exactly that  seamlessly. it has netted seven major telcos as customers  representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers. its deal with us telco sbc was the largest tv software deal to date  said mr graczyk.  iptv is about more than telcos  though. there are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net s power. jeremy allaire  chief of brightcove  told the bbc news website that it would be a flavour of iptv that was about harnessing the web as a  channel .   it is not just niches  but about exploiting content not usually viewed   he said.  we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content  and who often see unencumbered distribution.  for them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive   he said. this type of iptv service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives  for instance. what is a clear sign that iptv has a future is that microsoft is not the only player in the field. there are a lot of other  middleware  players providing similar management services as microsoft  like myrio and c-cor. but it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful.
sfa awaits report over mikoliunas the scottish football association is awaiting referee hugh dallas s report before acting against hearts winger saulius mikoliunas.  mikoliunas  20  barged linesman andy davis  who had advised dallas to award rangers an injury-time penalty in hearts s 2-1 defeat at tynecastle.  he was sent off for violent conduct in the 90th minute but we don t know if he did something else after the whistle.  we don t know how many red cards he was shown   said an sfa statement. hearts could also face action after three fans were arrested for throwing coins on the pitch. rangers  striker dad prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received a second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from craig gordon and leaving the hearts keeper on the ground. the sfa said:  once the referee s report comes in then we ll immediately look at things.   we don t normally get the reports until a couple of days after the game but we re well aware of what happened here.  prso was sent off for two cautions  and that will just be a one-match suspension.  the sfa is certain to come down hard on mikoliunas after southampton s david prutton was banned for 10-games on wednesday by the english fa for shoving referee alan wiley. hearts  boss john robertson said:  mikoliunas has thrown his chest against the assistant referee s chest and got a red card for it.  the officials have got to take into account the fact he s a young lad.  but people have got to take into account why he was incensed. why were 10 000 hearts fans incensed   why did nobody from the rangers  bench claim for a penalty kick   rangers  boss alex mcleish accepted referee dallas had no option but to send prso off. mcleish said:  i m glad to see the spirit of the players fighting to the very end - literally with dado trying to get the ball back from craig gordon.  but it was over-zealousness and i don t think hugh had any option.
yahoo moves into desktop search internet giant yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e-mail and other files on their pcs.  the firm is following in the footsteps of microsoft  google and ask jeeves  which have offered similar services. search has become a lucrative and hotly-contested area of expansion for net firms  looking to extend loyalty beyond the web. with hard drives providing bigger storage  users could need more help to locate important files  such as photos.  the desktop search technology has been licensed from a us-based firm x1 technologies. it is designed to work alongside microsoft s outlook and outlook express e-mail programs. searching e-mail effectively is becoming increasingly important  especially as the amount of spam increases. according to research from message analysts the radicati group  up to 45% of businesses  critical information is stored in e-mail and attachments. yahoo s software can also work separately on the desktop  searching for music  photos and other files. users can search under a variety of criteria  including file name  size  date and time. it doesn t yet incorporate web searching  although yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web-based and desktop data.  we are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content   said julian smith  an analyst with research firm jupiter.  it is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well   he said. search engines are often the first port of call for users when they go onto the web. the new foray into desktop search has rung alarm bells for human rights groups  concerned about the implications to privacy. and not everyone is impressed with the functionality of such services. alexander linden  vice president of emerging technologies at analyst firm gartner downloaded the google product but has since removed it.  it was just not very interesting   he said. he believes the rush to enter the desktop business is just a way of keeping up with rivals.  desktop search is just one of many features people would like but i m suspicious of its usefulness   he said. more useful would be tools that can combine internet  intranet and desktop search alongside improvements to key word searching  he said.
vw considers opening indian plant volkswagen is considering building a car factory in india  but said it had yet to make a final decision.  the german giant said it was studying the possibility of opening an assembly plant in the country  but that it remained only a  potential  idea. its comments came after the industry minister of india s andhra pradesh state said a team of vw officials were due to visit to discuss the plans. b. satyanarayana said he expected vw to co-sign a memorandum of agreement. several foreign carmakers  including hyundai  toyota  suzuki and ford  already have indian production facilities to meet demand for automobiles in asia s fourth-largest economy. vw s proposed plant would be set up in the port city of visakhapatnam on india s eastern coast. an andhra pradesh official added that vw had already approved a factory site measuring 250 acres.
aragones angered by racism fine spain coach luis aragones is furious after being fined by the spanish football federation for his comments about thierry henry.  the 66-year-old criticised his 3000 euros (£2 060) punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty.  i am not guilty  nor do i accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport   he said.  i m not a racist and i ve never lacked sporting decorum. i ve never done that and i have medals for sporting merit.  aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal team-mate and spanish international jose reyes last october.  the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones  but was then requested to do so by spain s anti-violence commission. the fine was far less than the expected amount of about £22 000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. arsenal boss arsene wenger  who was fined £15 000 in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating  believes that aragones  punishment was too lenient.  you compare his fine and my fine  and if you consider his was for racist abuse  then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should   wenger said.  he shouldn t have said what he said  and how much money is enough  i don t know but it doesn t look a big punishment.  however  aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair.  i have been treated like islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter manolete)   said aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions.  i have not liked one thing about this whole affair and i do not agree with the sanction. they have looked for a scapegoat.  spain s anti-violence commission must now ratify the spanish fa s decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. aragones has 10 days to appeal  and the commission can also appeal. alberto flores  president of the spanish fa s disciplinary committee  said no-one in the committee felt aragones was a racist nor had  acted in a racist way.   a fine  the highest we could apply  is sufficient punishment. suspension would have been a bit exaggerated   flores told sports daily marca.
chelsea clinch cup in extra-time (after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1)  john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but steven gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunez s header made for a tense finale. it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager. yet it was controversial too  after mourinho s sending off  apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans. there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.  riise could not have connected any better with morientes  cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past petr cech. the goal  the quickest-ever in a league cup final  stunned a blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week. the blues  attacking chances were limited  and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard s powerfully-struck drive and drogba s low shot. despite their frustration  chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpool s well-organised defence.  joe cole had a shot blocked and a promising damien duff break was halted by a good tackle from djimi traore  but the reds reached half-time without any major scares. the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back. nevertheless  liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from dudek on 54 minutes  first at full stretch from gudjohnsen s header  then to smother william gallas  follow-up. and despite chelsea s possession  it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech. and the blues  increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected ferrerira s free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level. that prompted mourinho s reaction which saw him sent off  but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. dudek saved bravely at the irishman s feet  while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. but seconds after the half-time interval  drogba made no mistake  picking the ball up from glen johnson s long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsen s cross in the 110th minute. there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level  but despite liverpool s desperate attacks  chelsea clung on to win.  dudek  finnan  carragher  hyypia  traore (biscan 67)  luis garcia  gerrard  hamann  riise  kewell (nunez 56)  morientes (baros 74).  subs not used: pellegrino  carson.  hyypia  traore  hamann  carragher.  riise 1  nunez 113.  cech  paulo ferreira  ricardo carvalho  terry  gallas (kezman 74)  jarosik (gudjohnsen 45)  lampard  makelele  cole (johnson 81)  drogba  duff.  subs not used: pidgeley  tiago.  lampard  kezman  drogba  duff.  gerrard 79 og  drogba 107  kezman 112.  78 000  s bennett (kent).
fiat mulls ferrari market listing ferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of fiat s carmaking operations  the financial times has reported.  it said fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $2bn (1.53bn euros; £1.05bn) settlement with gm about fiat s ownership. steps being considered include listing ferrari and bringing maserati and alfa romeo closer together  it said. despite strong sales of alfa romeo  fiat s car business is making a loss.  under the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. fiat owns a 56% stake in ferrari -best known for its dominant formula one motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. it considered floating ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to italian bank mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). that sale valued ferrari - which owns the maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. the price tag would change if maserati was stripped out. the financial times said fiat may transfer maserati within its wholly- owned alfa romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. such a move would help alfa romeo and maserati to share marketing  distribution and research & development costs. maserati and ferrari sell about 10 000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003.  fiat  italy s largest private sector employer  did not comment on the reported changes. fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with general motors. the us firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy fiat outright. analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which fiat now had to develop the business.
radcliffe enjoys winning comeback paula radcliffe made a triumphant return to competitive running with victory in the new york marathon.  the briton  running for the first time since dropping out of the olympic marathon and 10 000m  held off kenyan susan chepkemei in a thrilling finish. the pair were locked together for the last few miles before radcliffe finally sprinted clear to win in two hours  23 minutes and 10 seconds.  it s a good way to end the year   she said.  i m ready for a good rest now.  radcliffe decided only recently to run in the race and many had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her olympic ordeal just 11 weeks ago. but the world record-holder was prominent at the head of the field for the whole race as her rivals slowly dropped off the pace. just chepkemei and radcliffe were left in contention as the race came into the final few miles. the kenyan put in several bursts of speed to throw off radcliffe but the briton managed to hang in. both runners looked to be suffering as they reached the final mile in central park. but it was radcliffe who managed to dredge up a final sprint to see off chepkemei in the closest finish in the race s history and in the process make a huge step in erasing the disappointment she suffered in athens.
foxx and swank take actors awards jamie foxx and hilary swank have won the screen actors guild awards for best male and female film actors  boosting their oscars hopes this month.  foxx s portrayal of late soul-singer ray charles in ray had already earned him a prestigious golden globe award. swank triumphed for playing a gutsy female boxer in million dollar baby. modest wine country comedy sideways knocked out favourites million dollar baby and the aviator by taking the top prize for best cast performance.  the screen actors guild (sag) represents us film and tv actors. its winners often go on to win oscars. in other nominations  cate blanchett triumphed as the best supporting actress for her role as katharine hepburn in the aviator. veteran actor morgan freeman took the best supporting actor award for playing a prize-fighter turned gym manager in million dollar baby.   thank you for ray charles for just living so complex and so interesting  and making us all just come together   said foxx  accepting his award in los angeles on saturday.  he also praised the film director:  thank you for taylor hackford for taking a chance with an african-american film. taylor  you re my director of the year.  swank  too  was full of praise for her director and co-star clint eastwood.  i bow down to you   swank said to the 74-year-old eastwood.  you are a talent beyond compare. if i m half the person you are and half the talent you are when i m 74  i will know that i ve accomplished something great.   both foxx and swank are now considered to be among the favourites to get oscars - the hollywood s ultimate prize. however  swank has to overcome a strong challenge from annette bening  a nominee for the theatre farce being julia. meanwhile  ballots for oscars - the hollywood s top honours - were mailed earlier this week to members of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences. the voting is due to end on 22 february - five days before the ceremony.
brussels raps mobile call charges the european commission has written to the mobile phone operators vodafone and t-mobile to challenge  the high rates  they charge for international roaming.  in letters sent to the two companies  the commission alleged the firms were abusing their dominant market position in the german mobile phone market. it is the second time vodafone has come under the commission s scrutiny. the uk operator is already appealing against allegations that its uk roaming rates are  unfair and excessive . vodafone s response to the commission s letter was defiant.  we believe the roaming market is competitive and we expect to resist the charges   said a vodafone spokesman.  however we will need time to examine the statement of objections in detail before we formally respond.   the commission s investigation into vodafone and deutsche telekom s t-mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in germany.  the commission believes these wholesale prices are too high and that the excess is passed on to consumers.  the commission aims to ensure that european consumers are not overcharged when they use their mobile phones on their travels around the european union   the commission said in a statement. vodafone and o2  britain s other big mobile phone operator  were sent similar statements of objections by the commission in july last year. vodafone sent the commission a response to those allegations in december last year and is now waiting for a reply. the vodafone spokesman said a similar process would be set in motion with these latest statement of objections about its operations in germany.  the companies will have three months to respond to the commission s allegations and the process  may go on for some time yet   the spokesman said. the commission could charge the companies up to 10% of their annual turnover  though in practice that sort of figure is rarely demanded. the commission s latest move comes just a few months after national telecoms regulators across europe launched a joint investigation which could lead to people being charged less for using their mobile phone when travelling abroad. the investigation involves regulators assessing whether there is effective competition in the roaming market.
jugnot  tops french actor league  actor gerard jugnot - star of the oscar-nominated film the chorus - has beaten gerard depardieu to become france s best-paid actor of 2004.  jugnot made 5.45m euros (£3.77m) last year  according to a table drawn up by france s le figaro newspaper. in the chorus (les choristes)  jugnot plays an inspiring music teacher at a school for troubled boys in 1949. despite starring in five films in 2004  depardieu made 3.35m euros (£2.31m) putting him third place in the chart.  his name [depardieu] is no longer sufficient to guarantee the success of a film   said le figaro newspaper. the chorus  which jugnot also co-produced  has drawn an audience of nearly nine million people since its release last year.  godzilla star jean reno was france s second best-paid actor in 2004  earning 3.55m euros (£2.45m) . his roles include a recent uncredited cameo in the oscar-nominated hotel rwanda. the highest-ranking woman on le figaro s list was audrey tautou in 10th place  earning 885 000 euros (£611 000). she starred in jean-pierre jeunet s a very long engagement (un long dimanche de fiancailles) and is also lined up to co-star with tom hanks in ron howard s the da vinci code. the chorus is nominated for best foreign film at sunday s oscar ceremony. on saturday  it will compete for the title of best film against fellow nominee a very long engagement in france s cesar film awards.
gm in crunch talks on fiat future fiat will meet car giant general motors (gm) on tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the italian firm s loss-making auto group.  fiat claims that gm is legally obliged to buy the 90% of the car unit it does not already own; gm says the contract  signed in 2000  is no longer valid. press reports have speculated that fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim. both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand.  the meeting between fiat boss sergio marchionne and gm s rick wagoner is due to take place at 1330 gmt in zurich  according to the reuters news agency.  mr marchionne is confident of his firm s legal position  saying in an interview with the financial times that gm s argument  has no legs . the agreement in question dates back to gm s decision to buy 20% of fiat s auto division in 2000. at the time  it gave the italian firm the right  via a  put option   to sell the remaining stake to gm. in recent weeks  fiat has reiterated its claims that this  put  is still valid and legally binding. however  gm argues that a fiat share sale made last year  which cut gm s holding to 10%  together with asset sales made by fiat have terminated the agreement.  selling the fiat s car-making unit may not prove so simple  analysts say  especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to italy s industrial heritage. political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise.  we are not expecting fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling gm at this point   brokerage merrill lynch said in a note to investors  adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business.  as far as we are aware  the agnelli family  which indirectly controls at least 30% of fiat  has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business.  fiat may be willing to cancel the  put  in exchange for money.
kilroy-silk attacked with slurry euro mp robert kilroy-silk has had a bucket of farm slurry thrown over him by a protester in manchester.  the uk independence party member was arriving for a bbc radio show when the attacker emerged from behind a bush. fellow guest ruth kelly mp was also hit by the slurry. mr kilroy-silk said the man  who later disappeared  claimed he was  doing it in the name of islam . in january  mr kilroy-silk quit his bbc one show for remarks he made about arabs  who he called  suicide bombers .  mr kilroy-silk had already been taken off air by bbc bosses for the comments  in which he also described arabs as  limb-amputators  women repressors . the remarks prompted outrage among muslim groups. the slurry attack took place on friday as mr kilroy-silk and ms kelly  a cabinet office minister and bolton west mp  arrived at manchester high school for girls for the recording of bbc radio 4 s any questions.  the police were called but the attacker had disappeared by the time officers arrived. they are treating the incident as assault. the programme s host  jonathan dimbleby  later told the audience the mep had been covered from  head to toe . mr kilroy-silk was still able appear to appear on the show after being loaned a change of clothes.  he told reporters he was  very angry  and planned to press charges if his attacker was caught. he said the man shouted:  you ve offended my religion  i m doing this in the name of islam.   as i started to turn round a guy tipped a bucket of farmyard muck over me and then threw the rest of it over me and the car   mr kilroy-silk said.  i was totally covered  it was all through my clothes  and it stank to high heaven. it went all inside the car and splattered ruth kelly.  a bbc spokesman said:  he took his seat as jonathan dimbleby was introducing the show. fortunately someone at the school had a change of clothes to let him have.  greater manchester police said people near mr kilroy-silk had also been hit by the waste. officers took statements at the scene  but no arrests have been made. police say the suspect ran off after towards wilmslow road after committing the offence but is believed to have been driving a red vauxhall corsa earlier. the suspect is described as white  aged 30 to 40  with a ginger beard. police want to hear from anyone who has any information.  mr kilroy-silk  an mep for the east midlands  resigned the uk independence party whip in the european parliament in october  after criticising ukip and stating his ambition to be leader. however  he remains a member of the party. he said on friday he hoped to be elected party leader before christmas.  i think that is sufficient time for us to put in process what is necessary... in time for us to fight and have a significant impact upon the general election.  but a ukip spokesman said that would be impossible under the party s constitution  which requires 70 days before any leadership ballot can take place.
rich grab half colombia poor fund half of the money put aside by the colombian government to help the country s poor is benefiting people who do not need it  a study has found.  a total of 24.2 trillion pesos ($10.2bn; £5.5bn) is earmarked for subsidies for the poor  the government department for planning said. but it also found 12.1 trillion pesos was going to the richest part of the population  rather than to those in need. sound distribution of the cash could cut poverty levels to 36% from 53%  the government believes.  resources are more than enough to reduce poverty and there is no need for more tax reforms but a better distribution   deputy planning director jose leibovich said.  colombia has a population of about 44 million and half lives below poverty line. however  some large properties are paying less in tax as they are situated inside poor areas  which benefit from cheaper utilities such as electricity and water  government research found. government expenditure in areas such as pensions  public services  education  property and health should be revised  mr leibovich said. he added that the government is now examining the report  but warned there would be no easy solution to the problem. with a good distribution of such subsidies and economic growth of just 2%  by 2019 poverty could fall as low as 15.3%  he said.
german growth goes into reverse germany s economy shrank 0.2% in the last three months of 2004  upsetting hopes of a sustained recovery.  the figures confounded hopes of a 0.2% expansion in the fourth quarter in europe s biggest economy. the federal statistics office said growth for the whole of 2004 was 1.6%  after a year of contraction in 2003  down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. it said growth in the third quarter had been zero  putting the economy at a standstill from july onward. germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track  as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean german consumers have kept their money to themselves. major companies including volkswagen  daimlerchrysler and siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. according to the statistics office  destatis  rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand.  but the relentless rise in the value of the euro last year has also hit the competitiveness of german products overseas. the effect has been to depress prospects for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole  as well as germany. eurozone interest rates are at 2%  but senior officials at the rate-setting european central bank are beginning to talk about the threat of inflation  prompting fears that interest rates may rise. the ecb s mandate is to fight rising prices by boosting interest rates - and that could further threaten germany s hopes of recovery.
parliament s record of scandal in a locked room at the heart of parliament there is a hive of scandal.  sex  betrayal and custody of children are all there in this affair but this time it has nothing to do with the recent troubles of david blunkett or boris johnson.  few realise that westminster in effect has its own divorce den. for sprinkled among 12 floors of archives are blow-by-blow accounts of marital break-ups - and now you can search what s there online. until 1857  the only way in england to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an act of parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty. the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings  dating back to 1670  all recorded among the 325 000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in parliament s victoria tower. most people researching their family history want to discover some tale of illicit love. this gives them the chance.  divorce by parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids  butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses. among the records is the story of jane campbell  the first woman ever to divorce her husband. that happened in 1801 after she had discovered her husband  edward addison  had committed adultery with her sister jessy.  a transcript of evidence from jessy s maid  amelia laugher  shows her telling how addison frequently passed by her on the way to the room where she had just put her mistress naked to bed. it must have been a killer blow to addison s case - he had already fled abroad rather than pay the £5 000 damages ordered by a civil court. as well as making divorce history  jane campbell won custody of her children - unusual for a woman at the time. but divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and parliament.  there are the protestation returns from 1642 - lists of the protestants who pledged to  maintain the true reformed protestant religion . there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament  including composer george frideric handel in 1727. and the mass of private bills which  for example authorise the building of railways and roads  contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them.  tax bills may be an extra source for pedigree hunters - the longest stretches for about 300m and is longer than the palace of westminster itself  listing the names of appointed tax collectors. this wealth of material has long been open to the public at the house of lords record office  with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room. but now five years of work has produced an online catalogue. david prior  assistant clerk of the archives  says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research.  before  you just could not do it  you faced trawling through pages and pages of printed material   he says. mr prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally.  the archive profession may look fairly staid but is in an enormous period of change  mainly motivated by the potential of it  which is opening up all sorts of vistas for us   he says.  the archives do  of course  hold records of high (and low) politics too for both houses of parliament  including copies of all acts passed since 1497 - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk. records for the commons only date back to 1834 - anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the parliament buildings in 1834.  but that still leaves some of the most important documents of uk political history - parts of the bill of rights from 1689  the death warrant for charles i  the private papers and diaries of major politicians such as david lloyd george and andrew bonar law. there is also the 1606 act establishing 5 november as a thanksgiving day - the year after the gunpowder plot. that document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across london to mark the 400th anniversary of guy fawkes  conspiracy. as mr prior remarks as we walk by shelf after shelf of vellum (parchment made from goat s skin):  all human life is here.
absa and barclays talks continue south africa biggest retail bank absa has said it is still in talks with uk bank barclays over the sale of majority stake in the group.  in november  absa said it was close to striking a deal with barclays. but the group said barclays is still waiting for the approval of south africa s banking and competition authorities to make a formal offer. absa also announced that it expects to see earnings grow by 20-25% in its current financial year.   discussions with barclays are continuing  but shareholders are advised that no agreement has been reached as to any offer being made by barclays to acquire a majority stake in absa   absa said in a statement. if barclays buys a stake in absa it will be one of the largest foreign investments in south africa in recent years. absa currently has a market value of about $8.5bn (£4.4bn). analysts said absa s earnings forecast was better than expected. however  the company warned that headline earnings growth would be trimmed by about four percentage points because of share options for a black economic empowerment transaction and a staff share incentive scheme. the south african group will release its results for the year to 31 march on 30 may.
blues slam blackburn over savage birmingham have confirmed blackburn made a bid for robbie savage - but managing director karen brady has called it  derisory .  rovers have reportedly offered £500 000 up front for the wales star  30  with the fee rising to £2.2m. but brady told the sun the bid was  a waste of fax paper and my time . she added:  the way things are going all this could affect the relationship between the clubs. they ve got into robbie s head. but he s not for sale.  savage s future at birmingham has been the source of speculation for several weeks  with some fans criticising his performances for the club earlier in the season. however  good displays against west brom and aston villa have impressed blues fans.  the crowd gave me a massive standing ovation when i came off on saturday which was nice   he said.  it was fantastic even though i was criticised by a number of them in recent weeks and on saturday it showed how much i mean to them.  it s not for me to say (about transfer rumours)  it s between the two clubs.  i haven t created the speculation myself  i haven t phoned every national newspaper saying   blackburn are trying to buy me . it s not up to me.  birmingham manager steve bruce insists he does not want to sell savage.  a lot is said and written about sav but he has been terrific for birmingham city the last two and a half years   he said.   the fans love him because he epitomises them. he works hard  they like people like that and there are not many like him.  and why the hell should i sell him to someone else  i am not interested.
hague  given up  his pm ambition former conservative leader william hague says he will not stand for the leadership again  having given up his ambition to be prime minister.  mr hague  43  told the daily telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too  boring  and unfulfilling. mr hague  who stepped down after his party s 2001 election defeat  does not rule out a return to the front bench. he also told the paper he hopes to remain mp for richmond  north yorks  and start a family with wife ffion. mr hague  who recently had published the biography of william pitt the younger  also said he wanted to continue writing books and speech-writing.  he told the newspaper:  i don t know whether i will ever go back on to the front  but don t rush me.  asked if he would stand for the leadership again  mr hague replied:  no. definitely not.  his determination to stay away from a central role will disappoint some senior conservative members  who say the party needs him. tim collins  the shadow education secretary  said last week it would be a  huge boost  to the party if mr hague returned to the front bench. mr hague became an mp at 27 and leader of the opposition at 36. he said:  i feel fortunate that  by the age of 40  i had crammed in an entire political career.  i had been in the cabinet and been leader of the party  so now i can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling.  mr hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister.  maybe i wasn t as driven by politics as i thought i was   he said.
strong dollar  call halts slide the us dollar s slide against the euro and yen has halted after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was  in america s interest .  but analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the us economy were still significant. they also pointed out that positive comments apart  president george w bush s administration had done little to stop the dollar s slide. a weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. the dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100gmt  still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 november. against the japanese yen  it was trading at 105.28 yen  after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.  policy makers in europe have called the dollar s slide  brutal  and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. however  it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro s rise at a monthly meeting of eurozone ministers late on monday. higher growth in europe is regarded by us officials as a way the huge us current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. mr snow who is currently in dublin at the start of a four-nation eu visit  has applauded ireland s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth.  the eurozone is growing below its potential. when a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners   he said. mr snow s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on monday  but he was careful to qualify his statement.   our basic policy  of course  is to let open  competitive markets set the values   he explained.  markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.  us officials have also said that other economies need to grow  so the us is not the main global growth engine. economists say that the fundamentals  or key indicators  of the us economy are looking far from rosy. domestic consumer demand is cooling  and heavy spending by president bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (£230bn). the current account deficit  meanwhile  hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. for many analysts  a weaker dollar is here to stay.  no end is in sight   said carsten fritsch  a strategist at commerzbank .  it is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30.  some analysts maintain the us is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in europe  thus boosting its economy.
conservative backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards.  the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week s commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a  tough meeting  where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move  party sources told the bbc. the bill  which ministers claim will tackle crime  terrorism and illegal immigration  is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats.  they have said the scheme is  deeply flawed  and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been  agnostic  on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence  the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards  the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said.  it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.   lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.  the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it.  the new chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.
brown s poll campaign move denied the government has denied reports that gordon brown is preparing to oust alan milburn as labour s election supremo.  work and pensions minister alan johnson said it was wrong to suggest the chancellor would usurp mr milburn  adding they would  work as a team . a report in the sunday business claimed mr brown has been asked to take charge of media strategy  while mr milburn would move to a behind-the-scenes role. labour has always maintained mr brown would have a central campaign role.  but many labour backbenchers are said to be dissatisfied with the way election campaigning has gone and have said they wanted to see the chancellor take a bigger role. some commentators say the tories have grasped the initiative  putting labour on the back foot  having to respond to conservative policy announcements. these claims follow various opinion polls which suggest the tories have been gaining on labour. party strategists are believed to want to bring mr brown to centre-stage having seen support rise  in private polling  after his budget last week. but another report in the sunday telegraph claims mr milburn is unwilling to allow any new role for the chancellor to come at his expense. mr johnson told bbc news:  gordon brown will play a central role in any election campaign.  they were wrong when they said milburn was ousting brown and they re wrong now if they are saying brown is ousting milburn. we work as a team.  mr milburn has repeatedly said the chancellor was key to the campaign and dismissed claims of a rift. neither downing street nor the labour party would comment directly on the reports.
wi-fi web reaches farmers in peru a network of community computer centres  linked by wireless technology  is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in peru.  the pilot scheme in the huaral valley  80 kilometres north of the capital lima  aims to offer the 6 000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. the agricultural information project for farmers of the chancay-huaral valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation  enabling them to coordinate their actions. more than 13 000 rural inhabitants  as well as 18 000 students in the region  will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure.  the 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. the network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in september.  the non-government organisation  cepes (peruvian centre for social studies) led the $200 000 project  also backed by local institutions  the education and agriculture ministries  and european development organisations.  the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system   said carlos saldarriaga  technical coordinator at cepes. farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres  aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years  through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.  one of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system  with its flagship huaral.org website. there  farmers can find the prices for local produce  as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancay-huaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems.  water is the main element that unites them all. it is a precious element in peru s coastal areas  because it is so scarce  and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it   mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website. the information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region  and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of peru and even around the world.  cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project s success.  throughout the last three years  the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them   said mr saldarriaga. the community training sessions  attended by an equal number of men and women  have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm.  we have had an excellent response  mainly from young people. but we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women  who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives.  so far  the huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive  and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers  organisations in peru.  this is a pilot project  and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places   underlined mr saldarriaga.  the cepes researcher recalls what happened in cuyo  a 50-family community with no electricity  during the construction of the local telecentre site. there it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kw worth of power for the computers  the communications equipment and the cabin lights.  it was already dark when the technicians realised they didn t have any light bulbs to test the generator  so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs   recalls carlos saldarriaga.  the logical answer was  we don t sell any   so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing.  now  with the wireless network  cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.
critics back aviator for oscars martin scorsese s the aviator will win best film at the oscars  according to the uk s leading movie critics.  but several of those surveyed by the bbc news website think the veteran film-maker will lose the best director prize to clint eastwood. most of the critics tipped jamie foxx and hilary swank to scoop best actor and actress for ray and million dollar baby respectively. the jury comprised experts and critics from the top uk film publications. the panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to win.  all expect the aviator to win best film  but many think it will be a close race between scorsese s howard hughes biopic and eastwood s boxing drama million dollar baby. the other films nominated are wine comedy sideways  factual drama finding neverland  and ray charles biopic ray.   i m pretty sure this is the year of the aviator  though my own choice would be sideways   said the observer s philip french.  sideways should win but it doesn t have a hope   said jamie graham of total film  a position shared by film 2005 presenter jonathan ross.  the form going in to the oscars points to the aviator  but i liked million dollar baby more   said tim dams  news editor of trade weekly screen international.  five of the eight critics tipped scorsese to win best director  with mr dams  heat s charles gant and empire s angie errigo plumping for eastwood. sideway s alexander payne  ray s taylor hackford and british director mike leigh - nominated for period drama vera drake - are considered outsiders in this category.  up until recently i could have sworn scorsese would get it just for being scorsese   ms errigo told the bbc news website.  but i m beginning to think eastwood will get it.    i d be very happy for mike leigh to win  but i don t think he has any chance   said charles gant  film editor of heat. foxx s portrayal of ray charles has already seen him win prizes at the golden globes  baftas and screen actors guild awards. mr dams said this made him  out-and-out favourite  to be named best actor on oscar night.  everyone would be incredibly surprised if he didn t win   he said.  if you re a betting man  he s as close as you get to a certainty.   if paul giamatti was nominated for sideways it would be a different game   says total film s jamie graham.  but foxx will and should win.   with vera drake star imelda staunton nominated for best actress alongside kate winslet  britain has a good chance of victory - on paper. jonathan ross  for one  will be very happy if winslet wins for eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. but while wendy ide of the times still thinks staunton has a chance  heat s charles gant believes her bafta win will cut little ice with academy voters.  i d like staunton to win  but her chances are not that great   said mr gant  who predicted a second oscar for hilary swank.   i think swank will win   said mr french.  imelda has got as far as she s going to get playing that role.  staunton is also the personal choice of steven gaydos  executive editor of industry magazine variety. but while he tipped swank to win  he predicted it would be a close contest.  everything has the ability to flip by one vote and go the other way   he told the bbc news website.  there s not a sense that it s obvious how it s going to go.  meanwhile  thousands of people have voted in a bbc radio five live poll to find the best film never to have won a best picture oscar. the audience voted overwhelmingly for the shawshank redemption  the 1994 frank darabont tale of hope and humanity  which received 52% of the online votes and 68% of the text messages. the other two finalists  citizen kane and a matter of life and death split the remaining votes roughly equally. this year s academy awards will be shown in the uk by sky movies 1 at 0130 gmt on monday.  - tim dams  screen international: film - the aviator;

looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales  according to research from technology analysts gartner.  more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally  said the report  the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions  gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile  as well as new services such as music downloads  could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005  said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones  there was evidence  according to gartner  that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.   all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe   mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website.  japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years  time.  they already have tv  music  ringtones  cameras  and all that we can think of on mobiles  so people have stopped buying replacement phones.   but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too  according to gartner  as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade  said gartner. third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer  like video  could drive people into upgrading their phones  but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen.  at the end of the day  people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical.  nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.  more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics  as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005  she added. this was not a  women s thing   she said  but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned  but about what it said about its owner.  western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design   said ms milanesi.   people are after something that is nice-looking  and together with that  there is the entertainment side.  this year music will have a part to play in this.  the market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (£10.5 million) in 2004  but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (£9.4 million) by 2009  according to jupiter research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone  the w800  which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours  battery life  and a two megapixel camera. in july last year  motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity  which would not put too much strain on battery life.
pension hitch for long-living men male life expectancy is much higher than originally estimated  leading pension researchers have said.  the pensions policy institute (ppi) said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated. life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for a professional - a gap of eight years. but if measured at age 65 instead  the ppi said  a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years - a gap of just five years. the ppi s estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy.  the government has ruled out raising the state pension age  because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies. chris curry  ppi research director  said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged.  even people in social class v [unskilled manual workers] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age   he said. researchers have not updated life expectancy projections for women  who on average live longer than men.
federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic.  top seed federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. but ljubicic  who beat tim henman in the last eight  dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool  though  turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. the match was a re-run of last week s final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam  where federer triumphed  but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets.  i really wanted to get off to a good start this time  and i did  and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm   federer said.   that took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and i almost ran away with it. but he came back  and that was a good effort on his side.  ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set.  i didn t start badly  but then suddenly i felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. and with roger  if you relax for a second it just goes very quick   he said.  after those first three games it was no match at all. i don t know  it was really weird. i was playing really well the whole year  and then suddenly i found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court.  but despite his defeat  the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance.  i had a chance in the third  and for me it s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match.  it s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that i m up there and belong with top-class players.
campbell rescues arsenal sol campbell proved to be an unlikely match-winner to earn arsenal a hard-fought win at portsmouth.  the england defender lashed home a 25-yard shot for his first goal in 16 months to take arsenal back into second spot  five points behind chelsea. but before campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to pompey striker ricardo fuller. in the first half he blasted wide when clear  and his control let him down in the second half when well placed. portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny arsenal space in the early stages. but their marking was slack at a corner and patrick vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him 16 yards out. a mistake by arjan de zeeuw let thierry henry in behind the pompey defence on 17 minutes but as he bore down on goal linvoy primus got in a saving tackle. with just fuller as an out-and-out striker  portsmouth s shape made life difficult for arsenal. but a delightful touch by robin van persie gave henry a sight of goal  although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble jamie ashdown.  ashdown caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and kolo toure headed just wide and  as arsenal began to press  van persie blasted over a good opportunity after henry had set him up. henry took a quick return pass from vieira but ashdown was out quickly to block  and there were some anxious seconds for pompey as the ball ran loose before matthew taylor cleared. after playing second fiddle  portsmouth should have taken the lead on 34 minutes. referee howard webb played a good advantage to allow steve stone to send gary o neil away but  having shrugged off toure  the pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from 10 yards. as half-time approached  henry teased a shot through a ruck of players and inches wide. at the other end  fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as toure closed him down.  fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on 48 minutes when patrik berger s break and slipped pass played him clear. but a poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under vieira s challenge  referee webb was not interested. fuller paid the price when he gave way on 55 minutes to aiyegbeni yakubu  who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury. but it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from ashdown to cling on to van persie s shot as henry sniffed for scraps.  portsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper manuel almunia had to stand his ground to beat away a powerful shot from berger. arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of campbell. the england defender needed little invitation as pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past ashdown. arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when mathieu flamini escaped his marker to flash a header wide from henry s free-kick. almunia went full length to grab berger s long-range shot  while ashdown palmed away substitute dennis bergkamp s shot.  ashdown  griffin  de zeeuw  primus  taylor  stone  o neil  faye (berkovic 83)  berger  lualua  fuller (yakubu 55).  subs not used: hislop  quashie  cisse.  almunia  lauren  toure  campbell  cole  pires  flamini  vieira  clichy  van persie (bergkamp 68)  henry.  subs not used: lehmann  fabregas  senderos  hoyte.  cole.  campbell 75.  20 170.  h webb (s yorkshire).
gazprom  in $36m back-tax claim  the nuclear unit of russian energy giant gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.  vedomosti newspaper reported that russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. the paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company s export activity. gazprom  the biggest gas company in the world  took over nuclear fuel giant atomstroieksport in october 2004. the main project of atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in iran  which has been a source of tension between russia and the us.  gazprom is one of the key players in the complex russian energy market  where the government of vladimir putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm rosneft  the company that eventually acquired yuganskneftegas  the main unit of embattled oil giant yukos. claims for back-taxes was a tool used against yukos  and led to the enforced sale yuganskneftegas. some analysts fear the kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.
sony psp console hits us in march us gamers will be able to buy sony s playstation portable from 24 march  but there is no news of a europe debut.  the handheld console will go on sale for $250 (£132) and the first million sold will come with spider-man 2 on umd  the disc format for the machine. sony has billed the machine as the walkman of the 21st century and has sold more than 800 000 units in japan. the console (12cm by 7.4cm) will play games  movies and music and also offers support for wireless gaming. sony is entering a market which has been dominated by nintendo for many years.  it launched its ds handheld in japan and the us last year and has sold 2.8 million units. sony has said it wanted to launch the psp in europe at roughly the same time as the us  but gamers will now fear that the launch has been put back. nintendo has said it will release the ds in europe from 11 march.  it has gaming at its core  but it s not a gaming device. it s an entertainment device   said kaz hirai  president of sony computer entertainment america.
correction agency plans dropped plans to create a single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped.  the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments. the national correctional agency would have provided a  one-stop  justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition. instead  scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending. the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison  preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending.  scotland s reoffending rate is high  with more than 60% of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail. this is leading to an ever-expanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem. ministers thought merging the prison service with the council-controlled criminal justice social work departments  which provide community sentences  might have provided an answer. however  following a consultation on the idea  justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans. instead  ms jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system.  she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday  aiming to  break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community . the new measures will place a new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships. a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the sps s role and performance in reducing reoffending. the minister said:  better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there.  communities who are paying the price for this reoffending - both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs - expect better.  it costs the taxpayer £35 000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing.  taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison.  therefore  as we continue to invest in the service  it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves  to ministers and to parliament.
giggs handed wales leading role ryan giggs will captain wales as he wins his 50th cap in wednesday s friendly against hungary in cardiff.  john toshack  in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes  admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark.  with the games he s played for united  proportionately it doesn t seem that many for wales   toshack said.  but he s one of the greatest of all welsh internationals and on his 50th cap it s appropriate he s captain.  giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game  but is now targetting playing for wales in the 2008 european championships. the manchester united wing revealed how club manager sir alex ferguson talked him into extending his wales career.  i briefly discussed my international future with sir alex  but he urged me to carry on   giggs said.  he feels  like myself  that i have no weight problems and keep myself fit  so in three or four years  time i will be able to play in the european finals if we get there.  the manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because i am fit enough.   giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former wales skipper gary speed and united team-mate paul scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. but giggs is now focussed on making the toshack era even more successful than the time hughes spent at the helm. the manchester united winger won his first cap as a 17-year-old in 1991  an away loss to germany  and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. with giggs leading wales out against hungary  there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to speed. however  toshack refused to reveal whether he sees giggs as a long-term option.  for this particular game i think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain  it s his 50th cap and he s known for some time about that   toshack said. on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes  and giggs said:  it s my 50th cap and i am looking forward to it  and i hope to play a lot more times from here on in.  it s important to be here  all the players feel the same. it s a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important.  i see myself leading by example  it is something i have taken on for wales as well as united these past few seasons.  the way john is looking at things  he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament  the euro 2006 event.  i have told john i will be around for the next european tournament  by then i will be 35 so hopefully i will still be okay.  a lot can happen  but i m hoping to be around.  giggs  own personal future at old trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract  with manchester united offering one extra year and giggs seeking two.  i have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment   said giggs.  it is an important period for the club and i am just concentrated on that.  i ve heard the suggestions  hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what i am looking for  to get it sorted out.  i m enjoying my football  the way united have been playing and my own form  you have to enjoy it.  we have massive games coming up: manchester city this week  then the everton cup tie  followed by ac milan in the champions league  and my first wales game under john toshack  so it s an important time.

text messages aid disaster recovery text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia.  the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency. sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television. the blogging world  though  might know him better by his online name  morquendi. he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast. cell phone signals were weak. land lines were unreliable. so mr senanayake started sending out text messages. the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of  who needs what and where . blogging friends in india took mr senanayake s text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders. thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.  and that s when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use.  sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call   he says.   in every rural community  there s at least one person who has access to a mobile phone  or has a mobile phone  and can receive messages.  half a world away  in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago  taran rampersad read morquendi s messages. mr rampersad  who used to work in the military  knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages  and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. mr rampersad said:  imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets  and had a central place to send a text message to that effect.  he can message the server  so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field.  he added:  or  send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region  and they might have an excess of it  and be able to shift supplies to the right places.   mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september. last week  he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia.  in only 72 hours  he found dan lane  a text message guru living in britain. the pair  along with a group of dedicated techies  are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache. the idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help.  this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people   says paul saffo  a director at the california-based institute for the future.  you may be halfway around the world from someone  but in cyberspace you re just one click or one e-mail away   he said   that s put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery  where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they re not right on top of the tragedy.  it is still very early days for the project  though. in an e-mail  dan lane calls it  an early proof of concept.  right now  the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page  or distribute it to an e-mail list. in the near future  the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas  and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. but there s still another challenge. you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use.  it s amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to  and say  look this is what we re trying to do and everything like that   says mr rampersad.  so the big problem right now is the same problem we re trying to solve - human communication.  he is optimistic  however. he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments  too  will sit up and take notice. and he stands by his motto  courtesy of michelangelo: criticise by creating.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.
plan to give elderly care control elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.  ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves  not social workers  should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. they also plan a supremo for adult services in each english area to get different agencies working together. but the government shunned opponents  calls for free long-term care.  there are 1.7m people needing care in england and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050. monday s consultation paper on social care for adults in england is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency. health minister stephen ladyman said:  this document is the antithesis of the nanny state.   it s about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more.  the government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been  disappointing .  ministers say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in some local councils to use the payments. they also want to set up a new  half-way house  where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that  individual budget . the scheme will be funded on existing budgets set until 2008. but mr ladyman said the plans could deliver savings in some areas  such as freeing up nhs beds and preventing illnesses. he ruled out free personal care in england - which is on offer in scotland and wales  saying it was  unsustainable .  david rogers  from the local government association  said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government. and tony hunter  president of the association of directors of social services  said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. but age concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle  but not in practice. its director general  gordon lishman  said:  direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally.   the tories say people who pay for three years  long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives. tory spokesman simon burns said more than 80 000 long term care places had been lost since 1997.  after eight years of persistent change  dogmatic enforcement of regulation  and overbearing government initiatives - we need action  not a vision   said mr burns. the lib dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over £100 000. health spokesman paul burstow said:  promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share.  but the risk is that independence can turn into isolation if the right support and care is not available.
pm apology over jailings tony blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the uk s biggest miscarriages of justice.  the prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for ira bomb attacks on pubs in guildford and woolwich in 1974. mr blair said:  i am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice.  he made the apology to members of the conlon and maguire families in his private room at westminster. in a statement recorded for television  mr blair said the families deserved  to be completely and publicly exonerated .  the families had hoped the apology would be made during prime minister s questions in the house of commons. however  one of the so-called guildford four  gerry conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. he said mr blair had spoken with  such sincerity   adding:  he went beyond what we thought he would  he took time to listen to everyone.  you could see he was moved by what people were saying.  tony blair has healed rifts  he is helping to heal wounds. it s a day i never thought would come.  the move followed a huge campaign in ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the ira bombs which killed seven people. mr blair s official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would  ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister s statement brought to them .  most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. all were arrested because of a family connection to gerry conlon. mr conlon s father giuseppe was arrested when travelling to london from belfast to help his son. he died while serving his sentence. also arrested were anne maguire and members of her family. mrs maguire was the relative with whom giuseppe planned to stay in london  as well as two family friends. she said it was a  wonderful feeling  to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.   the people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent   she said. they were all jailed for handling explosives  based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. in october 1989 the court of appeal quashed the sentences of the guildford four  and in june 1991 it overturned the sentences on the maguire seven. mr conlon s case was highlighted in the oscar-nominated film in the name of the father  starring daniel day-lewis.
label withdraws mcfadden s video the new video of former westlife singer brian mcfadden has been pulled after a dublin school complained about being associated with his song irish son.  st fintian s high school says it is clearly identified in the video  while mcfadden never went there. mcfadden makes claims that he was beaten at his own school in the song s lyrics  saying it had  cell blocks . the performer s record label sony bmg has withdrawn the video and issued replacements to television stations. the label believed the school name was fictitious until they received the complaint. they have said the reference to the school was unintentional and coincidental.  the head of christian brothers  school st fintian s  richard fogarty  said the video implied that the 24-year-old pop star had attended his school and was abused there.  the school has always treated its pupils with respect   mr fogarty said in a statement. mcfadden makes specific references to the christian brothers in his song  but did not attend st fintian s. corporal punishment was outlawed in irish schools in 1982 when mcfadden was two years old.  mcfadden  whose debut solo album is released next week  has said that every song is autobiographical and  a true story . alcoholism and domestic violence are among the other topics dealt with in his songs  half of which have been written with robbie williams  former collaborator  guy chambers. mcfadden  who quit chart-topping group westlife in march  went to number one in september with his first solo single real to me. he enjoyed 12 chart-toppers with the boy band before parting company with them.
uk heading wrong way  says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed  michael howard has said.   britain is heading in the wrong direction   the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a  bossy  interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals   he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded:  britain is working  don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year  mr howard said.   we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale  the speed  the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp.  yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm  caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever.  he went on to reflect on the values that  most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election  he pledged to  turn these beliefs into reality  and set out the choices he says are facing britain.  how much tax do people want to pay  who will give taxpayers value for money  the clean hospitals and good  disciplined schools they want   who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system    mr blair has failed to tackle these problems  he claimed  saying he has the  wrong solution  to them.   the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives  undermining enterprise and denying people choice.  worst of all  it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.  the tories  he said  can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes.  we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance  the respect for the rule of law  the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential.  we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change.  this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months  he said  urging voters to hold him to account.  but labour spokesman mr kemp said:  it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april  not 1 january.   let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment  15% interest rates  record home repossessions  and the introduction of the poll tax.  with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government  of which he was a member  inflicted upon the country.

parmar ruled out of davis cup tie a knee injury has forced arvind parmar out of great britain s davis cup tie in israel and left alex bogdanovic in line to take the second singles place.  parmar picked up the injury last week and has failed to recover in time for the europe/africa zone i tie  which begins in tel aviv on friday. bogdanovic looks set to take the second singles place alongside greg rusedski. gb captain jeremy bates could use 17-year-old andrew murray and david sherwood in the doubles rubber. bogdanovic and murray both pulled out of tournaments last week through injury but are expected to be fit. jamie delgado and lee childs have been called into the squad in tel aviv as designated hitters for team practice but bates has no plans to call either of them into his squad at present.  the unheralded sherwood was the surprise inclusion when the squad was announced last week  and bates said:  david has earned his place in this squad on the merit of his form and results over the last 12 months.  the 6ft 4in sherwood is ranked 264th in the world and the lta have high hopes for him after futures tournament wins in wrexham and edinburgh.  the sheffield-born right-hander  aged 24  also reached another final in plaisir  france  a week after making the semi-final in mulhouse. bates is glad to have rusedski available after tim henman s retirement from davis cup tennis.  his wealth of experience is invaluable  particularly to the younger players and i know he will lead by example   bates said.  we are looking forward to the tie. the squad are all in excellent form.
federer joins all-time greats the last year has seen one player dominate men s tennis  and one country dominate the women s game.  roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in 1988 to win three grand slams in one season. and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win a grand slam at the french open  two more followed at wimbledon and the us open. meanwhile  briton tim henman enjoyed his best year  while greg rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles  and set about conquering new ground. the swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the australian open.  he ripped through the draw before beating marat safin in the final. andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon  and federer s performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking. federer again got the better of hewitt in the season-ending masters cup. his victory in houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final  an open era record. the only major let-down was a third-round loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open  and roland garros will be his main target in 2005.  there was also a surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games  which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold. another major trophy that looks beyond federer is the davis cup  which was won by spain in a 3-2 home success over the usa in seville. roddick struggled on the clay  losing to rafael nadal on the opening day before going down to carlos moya in the all-important fourth rubber.  henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the french open - a stunning effort - and also at the us open. a quarter-final defeat to mario ancic at wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the briton s defeat  but he remains optimistic of going further next year.  british number two rusedski endured a rollercoaster year  returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in march. with his ranking down at 168  many feared the 31-year-old s career was over  but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. the russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004  with myskina  maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams  before taking the season-ending fed cup. but while the young russians were on the way up  it was a different story for the belgians and the williams sisters. only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay  a stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo  whose grand slam drought goes on. the year started in regulation fashion as justine henin-hardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open.  a virus ruined the rest of henin-hardenne s year  although she was fit enough to win olympic gold  but clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. she suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt  and will be happy to see the year end. in their absence  myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic  but woeful  all-russian final at the french open. wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as sharapova captivated sw19  showing nerves of steel as she battled past davenport and serena williams to take the title.  davenport was a strong favourite for the us open but  hampered by injury  lost to the powerful and unflappable kuznetsova in the semis. kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing  with the latter s wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. with the russians still improving  the likes of henin-hardenne  clijsters  davenport  mauresmo  venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the men s side.
voters  reject eu by two to one  british voters would reject the european constitution by two to one  according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.  the daily telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. however the yougov poll  which questioned 1 943 british adults online  found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. another 7% said they would not vote at all. the poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum  expected in 2006. the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote.  ballot papers in the poll will ask:  should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union   the government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.  the treaty was signed by all 25 current eu members in rome last october and is due to come into force in november 2006  providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe  but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state eu.  if we reject this treaty  britain will be isolated and weak in europe   said foreign secretary jack straw  after the question was unveiled. mr straw  along with the rest of the cabinet  will back a  yes  vote. meanwhile  conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question  seems straightforward . but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution  when they should be treated as  two separate issues .
survey confirms property slowdown government figures have confirmed a widely reported slowdown of the uk s housing market in late 2004.  house prices were 11.8% higher on the year in the last quarter of 2004  down from 16.3% in the july-to-september quarter  the land registry said. the average house price in england and wales was £182 920  down from £187 971 in july-september. the volume of sales between october and december dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003. the government figures are the first official confirmation of falls in the market at the end of 2004. land registry figures are less up to date than those of banks and building societies  since they record completions not mortgage approvals. however  the figures are viewed as the most accurate measure of house prices as they include all property transactions  including cash sales.  the cost of buying a home fell in seven out of 10 regions between the third and fourth quarters of 2004.  the biggest annual gains were made in wales  where house prices were up by 23% in the fourth quarter. house prices rose the slowest in greater london  being up by 6%. in the capital  the volume of sales fell by 23% from 36 185 in 2003 to 28 041 for the same period in 2004. there was also a decline in the number of million-pound properties sold in the capital  with 436 properties over £1m sold compared to 469 for the same period in 2003. although the figures point to a slowdown in the market  the most recent surveys from nationwide and halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. after registering falls at the back end of 2004  halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in january and nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year. members of the bank of england s rate-setting committee will make their latest decision on interest rates on thursday.
public show for reynolds portrait sir joshua reynolds  portrait of omai will get a public airing following fears it would stay hidden because of an export wrangle.  the tate gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the uk. the 18th century painting has remained in storage but the owner has agreed to allow it to be part of an exhibition. the exhibition of reynolds  work will be shown at tate britain from may. joshua reynolds: the creation of celebrity will feature prints  caricatures  and sculpture by the 18th century artist  who painted some of the most famous personalities of his day. portrait of omai fetched the second highest amount for a british painting when it was sold at auction for £10.3m in 2001. it was bought by a london dealer who sold it on to a collector. the unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country  but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance.  in march 2004  the tate managed to raise £12.5m funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since. the portrait is of a young man who was dubbed  the noble savage  when he arrived in london from polynesia. he became a darling of london society and was invited to all the best parties by people who were fascinated by such an exotic character. sir joshua painted him after his arrival in 1774  and it became the artist s most famous work after it was first exhibited at the royal academy in 1776.
debate needed  on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet  the elections watchdog has said.  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.  there were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001  2002 and 2003  with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.  while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible   says its report. if there was to be a cap  it should be £10 000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons  european parliament  scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning  seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets  says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates  while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said:  there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced.  our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible.  the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.  he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.
jones doping probe begins an investigation into doping claims against marion jones has been opened by the international olympic committee.  ioc president jacques rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by victor conte  of balco laboratories. jones  who says she is innocent  could lose all her olympic medals after conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the sydney olympics. but rogge said it was too early to speculate about that  hoping only that  the truth will emerge .  any decision on the medals would be taken by the ioc s executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the games closing. the sydney olympics ended more than four years ago  but world anti-doping agency chief dick pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now.  we will find a way to deal with that   pound said. in a statement released through her attorney rich nichols  jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared.  victor conte s allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward   she said.  conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory  inconsistent statements.
uk gets official virus alert site a rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the uk government.  the service  it safe  will issue warnings about damaging viruses  software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones. alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves. the service will be free and those who sign up can get e-mail or text alerts. the scheme is aimed at home users and small businesses. the government estimates it will issue security alerts about six to 10 times a year  based on previous experience of virus outbreaks.  there is a clear need for easy-to-understand and simple independent advice for non-technically minded people who use computers either at home or at work   said home office minister hazel blears.  the purpose of this new government service is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with them easily and effectively without causing alarm.  those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people.  full-time staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people between alerts the service will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use their computers and phones.  it safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems  mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items  safe   said roger cumming  director of the national infrastructure security coordination centre (niscc).  the niscc  which is running the service  also stressed that those signing up would still need to use anti-virus software  firewalls  and software updates to stay secure. warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is  how it affects them and what they can do to avoid trouble. alerts will not be issued unless users can do something to protect themselves against the threat. this might include downloading an update from an anti-virus vendor or updating software to close loopholes and fix vulnerabilities. however no software patches or programs will actually be dispensed through the site. the alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms. the niscc spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets.  government statistics show that more than half of all uk households own a home computer. it was estimated that almost 13 million of these were able to access the internet in 2004. the launch comes as the number of viruses and other malicious programs in existence is reaching unprecedented numbers. in september 2004  the number of malicious programs circulating topped the 100 000 mark. some fear that this figure could hit 150 000 by september 2005. the creation of the national alert service follows similar efforts in the netherlands and us. the national alerting service for the netherlands (aka de waarschuwingsdienst) and the us national cyber alerting service also tell citizens of serious security threats.
davenport hits out at wimbledon world number one lindsay davenport has criticised wimbledon over the issue of equal prize money for women.  reacting to a disputed comment by all england club chairman tim phillips  the american said:  i think it is highly insulting if prize money is taken away.  somebody  i think it was mr phillips  said they won t have money for flowers at wimbledon. that s insulting.  an all england club spokesperson denied phillips made the remark  insisting:  he definitely didn t say it.  the statement added:  it was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the wimbledon grounds.   davenport was speaking following the announcement that this week s dubai duty free event will join the us and australian opens in offering equal prize money for women.  you hear about women playing only three sets while men play five   said daveport.  and the best women are never going to beat the best men.  but it s a different game you go to watch with the women - it doesn t make it better or worse.  hopefully we will be able to change people s minds.   serena williams  who is also in dubai  added:  i m obviously for equal prize money.  women s tennis is exciting. men s tennis is exciting as well  but the women have it right now.  if you are bringing in the spectators you should be able to reap what everyone else is able to reap.
borussia dortmund near bust german football club and former european champion borussia dortmund has warned it will go bankrupt if rescue talks with creditors fail.  the company s shares tumbled after it said it has  entered a life-threatening profitability and financial situation . borussia dortmund has posted record losses and missed rent payments on its westfallen stadium. chief executive gerd niebaum stepped down last week and creditors are now pushing for greater control. shares in borussia dortmund  germany s only stock-market listed football club  dropped by almost 23% to 2.05 euros during early afternoon trading.  fund manager florian hamm - borussia dortmund s largest investor - said he would only invest more money in the company if he got a greater say in how it is run.  i demand better transparency   he is quoted as saying by germany s manger magazin. the club has also faced calls to appoint executives from outside the club.  borussia dortmund posted a record loss of 68m euros ($89m; £47m) in the 12 months through june. it made a loss of 27.2m euros in the first half of the current fiscal year and said that total debts will increase to 134.7m euros by the middle of 2006 unless a restructuring plan is pushed through.  this is the bill for their mismanagement over the past years   said hvb analyst peter-thilo halser. the club appointed an auditor  who has recommended a number of steps  including deferring the rent due on the stadium and suspending debt repayments until at least the 2006-2007 fiscal year. stephen schechter  a uk investment banker who has held talks with borussia dortmund over a possible bond sale  said the club needs a capital injection of 35m euros.  they need strong people on the board who do not have a history with the club   he said.
tv show unites angolan families angolan families who are attempting to track each other down  after being separated by nearly 30 years of war  are succeeding thanks to a hugely popular tv show.  meeting point has become one of tv angola s most watched programmes  and has reunited hundreds of families. it runs daily  not only on the television but also on the radio. every friday  hundreds of people gather in luanda s independence square to record a message in front of the tv cameras  in the hope that a lost relative will see it. many relatives have been reunited on air.  at the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge  huge crowds   sergio gera  the programme s chief co-ordinator  told bbc world service s assignment programme.  now things are a little calmer  there are slightly less people - but  after two and a half years of broadcasting  there are still a lot of people going.   the media in the southern african country  twice the size of france  has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives. hundreds of thousands of people died in angola s 30-year civil war  which finally ended in 2002  and tens of thousands of people are still missing. many have not heard anything for 10 or more years - in all  90% of angolan families have lost someone.  the idea of recording in independence square was modelled on a square in the argentine capital buenos aries  where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing  and to exchange news. one woman  victoria lapete  found her sister - the only remaining member of her family - in independence square live on meeting point. she had not seen her sibling for 28 years.  when we saw each other  we threw ourselves into each other s arms   she told assignment.  we started to cry. i felt very  very happy  because i d spent so long without any family. suddenly i had a sister again.  however  angola is one of the poorest countries in africa  and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few. this means that elsewhere in the country  the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the international committee of the red cross (icrc). in the city of wambo  the icrc runs the gazetta - a 200-page  tabloid-size book which contains 13 000 names of missing or displaced.  their task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country.  it s very difficult - there are many displaced   stated joaquim sahundi  head of tracing in wambo.   as they try to go back [home]  others are trying to relocate their relatives. many people are getting injured because of that - in the villages  in the bush  there has been no clearance of mines.  when people are crossing these areas  they step on mines.  the icrc also uses the media where it can  running four daily broadcasts of their lists of the missing on radio angola. meanwhile  there remain massive challenges to angolan families even once they are reunited.  the programme of family reunification is extremely important  but for these families to remain reunified  there has to be social integration  job access  education  healthcare   said rafael marques of the pro-democracy george soros foundation for southern africa.  essentially the government is waiting for the international community to pay for the reconstruction - that s why it has been persistently calling for a donor s conference. that is just a way of detaching itself from its political responsibilities.
munster cup tie switched to spain munster s heineken cup quarter-final tie against biarritz on 3 april has been switched to real sociedad s paseo de anoeta stadium in san sebastian.  real s ground holds 32 000 whereas the parc des sports aguilera in biarritz has a capacity of just 12 667. the irish province will be given at least 8 000 tickets.  the decision to move was a difficult one  but as we considered the fans as one of our primary objectives   said biarritz chairman marcel martin.  we hope we will be rewarded as a huge crowd behaving in the best rugby tradition.  the match will be the first heineken cup fixture to be played in spain  and is expected to attract the biggest-ever attendance for a rugby match in the country. ulster were the last irish team to play at the paseo de anoeta stadium where they faced a euskarians side during a pre-season tour in 1998.

france v wales (sat) stade de france  paris  saturday  26 february  1600 gmt  bbc1  radio 4 lw and this website  france may have beaten scotland and england but they were tedious and uninspired throughout both matches. wales  on the other hand  have played some fine rugby and have made their best start since they last won the title in 1994. they also have a good record at the stade de france  having won their first two games there  in 1999 and 2001. wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed italy 38-8 in rome.  kevin morgan takes over from his injured newport-gwent dragons colleague hal luscombe on the right wing. in the pack neath-swansea ospreys forward ryan jones bas been brought on the blind-side flank to beef up the wales back row in place of jonathan thomas. wales coach mike ruddock is determined that his team will not go into their shells after their promising start to the championship.  graham henry (former wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should  be bold  when going to france  and he was proved right   said ruddock.  that is a great way to approach the game  and something we will further endorse with the players this week.   despite their stuttering displays in their first two games defending champions france are also unbeaten. under-pressure coach bernard laporte has made four changes  with yannick nyanga  the debutant julien laharrague  aurelien rougerie and yannick jauzion coming into the side. france have been criticised for the absence of traditional  french flair  as they have ground their way to victory so far this year but captain fabien pelous sees hope on the horizon.  i get the impression we are getting better   he said.  against wales  which is different from the teams we have beaten  i hope we can show our proper game.   j laharrague; a rougerie  y jauzion  d traille  c dominici; y delaigue  d yachvili; s marconnet  s bruno  n mas; f pelous (capt)  j thion; s betsen  y nyanga  j bonnaire (bourgoin).  w servat  o milloud  g lamboley  i harinordoquy  p mignoni  f michalak  j-p grandclaude.  g thomas (capt); k morgan  t shanklin  g henson  s williams; s jones  d peel; g jenkins  m davies  a jones; b cockbain  r sidoli; r jones  m williams  m owen.  r mcbryde  j yapp  j thomas  r sowden-taylor  g cooper  c sweeney  r williams.
yelling takes cardiff hat-trick european cross-country champion hayley yelling completed a hat-trick of wins in the reebok cardiff cross challenge in bute park on sunday afternoon.  the part-time maths teacher beat irish international jolene byrne by 40 metres in the six-kilometre race. another great britain international  louise damen  finished third as part of the contingent representing england. peter riley  who secured bronze for the gb men s team at last month s european championships  won the men s 9km race. riley  representing england  moved away over the last two kilometres to win by 25 metres from ireland s gary murray. glynn tromans - the reigning uk inter-countries and england cross-country champion - came in third place as he continues his comeback from a five-month injury lay-off.
safin cool on wimbledon newly-crowned australian open champion marat safin has ruled out any chance of winning wimbledon in the future.  after losing in round one last year  safin said he had  given up  on wimbledon and winning his second grand slam title has not changed his mind.  i ll play  but with no expectations. i feel like i can t waste my time  my energy on that surface   he said.  some people  they cannot play on clay. some people  they cannot play on a hard court. me  i can t play on grass.  however  safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles.  it s a relief for me. two grand slams  it s already something. but with this one i worked really hard for it   he said.  basically  i would love to win a couple more. i think i have a chance if i continue this way.   if (coach) peter lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer  i think i can make it.  the 25-year-old shocked pete sampras in the 2000 us open final to win his first major title but then lost in two australian open finals. safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another grand slam.  i didn t expect that (to win the 2000 us open) - it was against sampras  i wasn t the favourite so i had no pressure whatsoever   he said.  after the first final that i didn t win against thomas johansson (in 2002)  i couldn t see myself winning the grand slams anymore.  i was once in the semi-finals of the french open  but i didn t believe i can win it.  i just couldn t handle the pressure. you need to believe in yourself  and i didn t.   and after losing the first set 6-1 to lleyton hewitt in sunday s final  safin said he began to doubt himself again.  i am 25. i m playing against hewitt. at least you have to have the opportunity to win it  at least have a chance   he said.  it s like you go there and you lose first set 6-1  then you start to think:  this is not my day. the way i m playing is ridiculous.   but then you start to really be a little bit more selfish and try to find a way out of there.  and i found it. i was like really much i was much happier than in 2000  that s for sure  because i get over it.
us tv cuts nudity from bbc film a us tv network is editing bbc films  dirty war to avoid showing the front of a nude woman being scrubbed down after a fictional chemical attack.  it is not worth showing  non-essential  nude scenes when indecency complaints are  aggressively pursued  by us tv watchdogs  said pbs  jacoba atlas. dirty war - screened uncut on bbc one last september - depicts a dirty bomb attack on the city of london. it is also being screened uncut on us cable channel hbo on 24 january. pbs said it will use extra footage for its broadcast  showing the woman  from a more discreet angle  instead.  the us federal communications commission fined cbs $550 000 (£306 814) last autumn for singer janet jackson s  wardrobe malfunction   during which her breast was exposed during a dance routine with justin timberlake. many us networks and broadcasters are now more nervous about airing nudity  violence or bad language. ms atlas said pbs could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of dirty war  and it could also deter many of its 170 individual stations from airing  an important film .  you want to pick your battles   she said. she added that pbs  which is a private  non-profit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation s 349 public television stations  is bolder about screening non-fiction or historical programming. pbs is seen in virtually all us homes with tv  and describes itself as a  trusted community resource  serving nearly 100 million people each week.
salary scandal in cameroon cameroon says widespread corruption in its finance ministry has cost it 1bn cfa francs ($2m; £1m) a month.  about 500 officials are accused of either awarding themselves extra money or claiming salaries for  non-existent  workers. prime minister ephraim inoni  who vowed to tackle corruption when he came to office last year  said those found guilty would face tough punishments. the scam is believed to have begun in 1994.  the prime minister s office said the alleged fraud was uncovered during an investigation into the payroll at the ministry. in certain cases  staff are said to have lied about their rank and delayed their retirement in order to boost their earnings. the prime minister s office said auditors had found  irregularities in the career structure of certain civil servants . it added that the staff in question  appear to have received unearned salaries  boosting the payroll .  fidelis nanga  a journalist based in the cameroon capital yaounde  said the government was considering taking criminal action against those found guilty and forcing them to repay any money owed.  the prime minister has given instructions for exemplary penalties to be meted out against the accused and their accomplices if found guilty   he told the bbc s network africa programme.  mr inoni launched an anti-corruption drive in december after foreign investors criticised a lack of transparency in the country s public finances. in one initiative designed to improve efficiency  civil servants who arrived late for work were locked out of their offices. the government now intends to carry out an audit of payrolls at all other government ministries. in a report compiled by anti-corruption body transparency international in 2003  graft was said to be  pervasive  in cameroon.
woodward eyes brennan for lions toulouse s former irish international trevor brennan could be one of clive woodward s many surprises when the 44-man lions tour squad is announced.  brennan  who last played for ireland against samoa in 2001  is held in high esteem by the former england coach.  if you speak to the players there s a huge amount of respect for the guy   woodward told the sunday independent.  players tend to know better than most coaches. it s not just the irish  but welsh and english players as well.  the 31-year-old former dublin milkman moved from leinster to toulouse in 2003 and immediately picked up a heineken cup winner s medal in an all-french final against perpignan at lansdowne road.  brennan is highly-rated at stade toulousain  where he is used anywhere in the back five. woodward is ensuring his preparations for the trip to new zealand in june are as thorough as possible.  i ve spoken to quite a few players  and they probably don t know what they re actually saying when we re having these conversations   he told the newspaper.  but you talk about certain players and they ll say if they think they re up to scratch or that they don t want them in their team.  i haven t heard a bad word said against trevor  which  considering he has a pretty tough guy reputation  is  to me  impressive.
britons fed up with net service a survey conducted by pc pro magazine has revealed that many britons are unhappy with their internet service.  they are fed up with slow speeds  high prices and the level of customer service they receive. 17% of readers have switched suppliers and a further 16% are considering changing in the near future. it is particularly bad news for bt  the uk s biggest internet supplier  with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining.  a third of the 2 000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks tim danton  editor of pc pro magazine.  we expect these figures to leap in 2005. every month the prices drop  and more and more people are trying to switch   he said. the survey found that bt and tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator  making it hardly worth while swapping.  other found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers. 12% of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all.  we discovered a huge variety of problems  but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier   said tim danton  editor of pc pro.  this breaks the code of practice  but because that code is voluntary there s nothing we or ofcom can do to help   he said. there is a vast choice of internet service providers in the uk now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages. with prices set to drop even further in coming months mr danton advises everyone to shop around carefully.  if you just stick with your current connection then there s every chance you re being ripped off   he warned.
verizon  seals takeover of mci  verizon has won a takeover battle for us phone firm mci with a bid worth $6.8bn (£3.6bn)  reports say.  the two firms are expected to seal the deal on monday morning  according to news agency reports  despite what was thought to be a higher bid from qwest. the us telecoms market is consolidating fast  with former long-distance giant at&t being bought by former subsidiary sbc earlier this year for $16bn. mci exited bankruptcy in april  having gone bust under previous name worldcom. the bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.  shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed  while 20 000 workers lost their jobs. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial  accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour  paying the securities and exchange commission $250m in october to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep wall street happy.  mci is the us s second-biggest long distance firm after at&t. consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. a merger between mci and verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october. last week  sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about $16bn. buying mci would give either qwest or verizon access to mci s global network and business-based subscribers. the rationale is similar to the one underpinning sbc s at&t deal. verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.
a november to remember last saturday  one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world.  that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham. but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level  at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion  with australia s triumph in london followed by france s capitulation to new zealand.  clearly  there is no number one side in the world at the moment   declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney.  there are four  five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%.   while that bodes well for rugby as a whole  it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade. while the wallabies  all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year  europe s finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray. and for the first time in more than a decade  it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title.  that owes much to ireland s continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays.    who secured a first triple crown in 19 years last season  could go one better and win their first five/six nations title since 1985. they start with away games against italy and scotland  before england and france come to lansdowne road.  their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland s self-belief  while ronan o gara s late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie o sullivan s side can now close out tight games. not that england or france  who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them  will lay down quietly.  dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio  they still have the personnel to prosper.  the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden  but the fresh shoots of post-world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson. a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident  and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff  a fourth title in six years is within reach.  are in familiar revival territory  but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style.  while south africa s over-confidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected  wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory. if mike ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack  there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february. the last fortnight has left  in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia. a stunning defeat to argentina  their first loss since the world cup  could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency.  but the manner of new zealand s 45-6 demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard. fortunately for the french  the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining  in paris. after two reasonable performances against australia  the scots  humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent. while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations  a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts.    who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland  are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship. as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime  the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february.
radcliffe yet to answer gb call paula radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the world cross-country championships.  the 31-year-old is concerned the event  which starts on 19 march in france  could upset her preparations for the london marathon on 17 april.  there is no question that paula would be a huge asset to the gb team   said zara hyde peters of uk athletics.  but she is working out whether she can accommodate the worlds without too much compromise in her marathon training.  radcliffe must make a decision by tuesday - the deadline for team nominations. british team member hayley yelling said the team would understand if radcliffe opted out of the event.  it would be fantastic to have paula in the team   said the european cross-country champion.  but you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus.  she is not messing us around. we all understand the problem.  radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year s event because of injury. in her absence  the gb team won bronze in brussels.
uganda bans vagina monologues uganda s authorities have banned the play the vagina monologues  due to open in the capital  kampala this weekend.  the ugandan media council said the performance would not be put on as it promoted and glorified acts such as lesbianism and homosexuality. it said the production could go ahead if the organisers  expunge all the offending parts . but the organisers of the play say it raises awareness of sexual abuse against women.  the play promotes illegal  unnatural sexual acts  homosexuality and prostitution  it should be and is hereby banned   the council s ruling said.  the show  which has been a controversial sell-out around the world  explores female sexuality and strength through individual women telling their stories through monologues. some parliamentarians and church leaders are also siding with the media council  uganda s new vision newspaper reports.  the play is obscene and pornographic although it was under the guise of women s liberation   mp kefa ssempgani told parliament.  but the work s author  us playwright eve ensler  says it is all about women s empowerment.  there is obviously some fear of the vagina and saying the word vagina   ms ensler told the bbc.  it s not a slang word or dirty word it s a biological  anatomical word.  she said the play is being produced and performed by ugandan women and it is not being forced on them. the four ugandan ngos organising the play intended to raise money to campaign to stop violence against women and to raise funds for the war-torn north of the country.  i m extremely outraged at the hypocrisy   the play s organiser in uganda  sarah mukasa  told the bbc s focus on africa programme.  i m amazed that this country uganda gives the impression that it is progressive and supports women s rights and the notions of free speech; yet when women want to share their stories the government uses the apparatus of state to shut us up.
bees handed potential man utd tie brentford face a home tie against holders manchester united in the fa cup sixth round if they can come through their replay against southampton.  the league one side held the saints at st mary s in their fifth-round tie and were rewarded with a potential draw against sir alex ferguson s side. newcastle will be at home to either tottenham or nottingham forest. bolton host arsenal or sheffield united and leicester will visit the winners of the burnley and blackburn replay. the ties will be played on the weekend of 12-13 march.  was delighted to be paired with united  although he admitted they still have plenty of work to do to set up a dream tie.  we ve got our work cut out next tuesday but you can t deny it s exciting   he said.   it would be a sell-out. it will probably be on television. we have financial problems and the revenue it could bring in would certainly help our situation.  we re happy to be in the draw but we ve still got to beat a premiership team.  we ve got to beat southampton first and that s going to be a hard game but if we do there will be some celebration.   welcomed the opportunity to face united.  we re not counting on anything yet   he said.  it is obviously going to be a difficult replay judging by the way brentford came back at us on saturday and the fact that united have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive.  but i ve been drawn against united so many times in cups and beaten them at both bournemouth and west ham.  there are no easy ties in the fa cup and i m sure nobody is counting on one.   newcastle v tottenham or nottingham forest  southampton or brentford v manchester united  bolton v arsenal or sheffield united  burnley or blackburn v leicester

security warning over  fbi virus  the us federal bureau of investigation is warning that a computer virus is being spread via e-mails that purport to be from the fbi.  the e-mails show that they have come from an fbi.gov address and tell recipients that they have accessed illegal websites. the messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the fbi s internet fraud complaint center. an attachment in the e-mail contains the virus  the fbi said. the message asks recipients to click on the attachment and answer some questions about their internet use. but rather than being a questionnaire  the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient s computer  according to the agency. it is not clear what the virus does once it has infected a computer. users are warned never to open attachment from unsolicited e-mails or from people they do not know.   recipients of this or similar solicitations should know that the fbi does not engage in the practice of sending unsolicited e-mails to the public in this manner   the fbi said in a statement. the bureau is investigating the phoney e-mails. the agency earlier this month shut down fbi.gov accounts  used to communicate with the public  because of a security breach. a spokeswoman said the two incidents appear to be unrelated.
fox attacks blair s tory  lies  tony blair lied when he took the uk to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign  say the tories.  tory co-chairman liam fox was speaking after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a  hard right agenda . dr fox told bbc radio:  if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war  i guess you are going to lie about anything at all.  he would not discuss reports the party repaid £500 000 to lord ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.  the prime minister ratcheted up labour s pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party s spring conference. he insisted he did not know the poll date  but it is widely expected to be 5 may.  in what was seen as a highly personal speech in gateshead on sunday  mr blair said:  i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of 10 downing street.  he described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric  then struggling to live up to the expectations  and reaching the point of raised voices and  throwing crockery . he warned his supporters against complacency  saying:  it s a fight for the future of our country  it s a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win.   mr blair said that whether the public chose michael howard or mr kennedy  it would result in  a tory government not a labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward . dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents  policies and then attacking the lies.  what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and it s going to be fear and smear   he told bbc news. the tory co-chairman attacked labour s six new pledges as  vacuous  and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid £500 000 to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election.  we repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters   he said  insisting he enjoyed a  warm and constructive  relationship to lord ashcroft.  meanwhile lib dem leader charles kennedy is expected to attack mr blair s words as he begins a nationwide tour on monday. mr kennedy is accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester  liverpool  leicester  somerset  basingstoke  shrewsbury  dorset and torbay. he said:  this is three-party politics. in the northern cities  the contest is between labour and the liberal democrats.  in southern and rural seats - especially in the south west - the principal contenders are the liberal democrats and the conservatives  who are out of the running in scotland and wales.  the lib dems accuse mr blair of making a  touchy-feely  speech to labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.
stam spices up man utd encounter ac milan defender jaap stam says manchester united  know they made a mistake  by selling him in 2001.  the sides meet at old trafford in the champions league game on wednesday and the 32-year-old s dutchman s presence is sure to add spice to the fixture.  united made a mistake in selling me   stam told uefa s champions magazine.  i was settled at manchester united  but they wanted to sell me. if a club want to sell you  there is nothing you can do. you can be sold like cattle.  sir alex ferguson surprised the football world - and stam - by selling the dutchman to lazio for £16.5m in august 2001. the decision came shortly after stam claimed in his autobiography that ferguson had tapped him up when he was at psv eindhoven. but ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. the affair still rankles with the dutchman.   i was settled at manchester united  i had even just ordered a new kitchen  but they wanted to sell me   he said.  in what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes   of course  you can refuse to go  but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. i don t agree that players control the game.  there have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers  but i have turned them down. what s the point    wednesday s game at old trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between united s young attackers wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo and milan s veteran defence of stam  paolo maldini  cafu and alessandro costacurta. stam says rooney s teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game.  we can t all be wayne rooneys - at his age i was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone   he said.  starting late can be a good thing. some kids who start early get bored.  i had my youth - having fun  drinking beers  blowing up milk cannisters. it sounds strange but it s a tradition where i grew up in kampen - and i had done all the things i wanted to do.
o sullivan quick to hail italians ireland coach eddie o sullivan heaped praise on italy after seeing his side stutter to a 28-17 victory in rome.   it was a hell of a tough game   said o sullivan.  we struggled in the first half because we hadn t the football.  italy played really well. they handled the ball well in terms of kicking it  if that s not an oxymoron.  we said before the game that it might take until 10 minutes from the end for this game to be won  and that s how it turned out.  ireland struggled to cope with italy s fierce start and were indebted to skipper brian o driscoll  who set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer.  we had our first attack in the italian half after 22 minutes   said o sullivan.  we had a good return  with three first-half possessions in their half and we scored twice.  the second half was about spending more time in their half.  scrum-half peter stringer was also glad that ireland escaped wtih a victory.  all credit to them   he told bbc sport.  we knew it would be tough coming to rome. they always give us a tough game here and they showed a lot of spirit.  they had a lot of ball in the first half but we got a few scores when we got into their 22.
moya emotional after davis cup win carlos moya described spain s davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usa s challenge in seville.  moya made up for missing spain s 2000 victory through injury by beating roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead.  i have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day   said moya.  all my energy has been focused on today.  what i have lived today i do not think i will live again.  spain s only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia  when they beat australia. and moya  nicknamed charly  admitted:  the davis cup is my dream and i was a bit nervous at the outset.  some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way. it helps me reach my goals if i am obsessed.  it s really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.  spanish captain jordi arrese said:  charly played a great game. it was his opportunity and he hasn t let us down.  he had lost three times to roddick  and this was his day to beat him.  he had been waiting years to be in this position.  spain s victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal  who beat roddick in the opening singles.  aged 18 years and 185 days  the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup.  what a great way to finish the year   said nadal afterwards. us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface.  i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.   obviously it s unrealistic to say that we re going to just start playing constantly on clay  with the schedule.  but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff   said mcenroe. roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of seville s olympic stadium.  it s just tough because i felt like i was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world   said the american.  i had my chances and just didn t convert them. the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend.  they came out  took care of business and they beat us. it s as simple as that.
muslims discuss election concerns issues that muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by uk community representatives.  the event is being held by the muslim association of britain (mab)  which believes muslim voters could influence the result in up to 50 constituencies. last year mab  which opposed the war in iraq  urged muslims not to vote for labour in the european elections. but a spokesman stressed the meeting was  not necessarily anti-labour .  this meeting is not anti-party in particular  it s anti-policy  it s on the issues we are going to ask muslims to vote on   mab spokesman dr azzam tamimi said of tuesday s event.   there are issues of concern to muslims  and muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues.  dr tamimi said the main issues muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on iraq  the palestinian situation  the erosion of civil liberties for muslims in the uk and economic  social and education problems.  approximately 1.1m of the uk s 1.6m muslims are of voting age. previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted labour  but more recent studies have suggested labour support has been falling away significantly among some muslim voters.  anger over the war in iraq has appeared to be the main reason  with many saying it was  unjustified . representatives from a number of muslim organisations will attend tuesday s event. among them will be the muslim council of britain (mcb). the chairman of the mcb s public affairs committee  sher khan  said the war in iraq would be a  significant factor  affecting muslims  voting intentions.  i think it s going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact   mr khan said.  however  professor john curtice  of the university of strathclyde  is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by muslims could make.  for the most part the labour constituencies where there s a large muslim community are relatively safe  but there are one or two that are not quite so safe   professor curtice said.  the constituencies where labour was most at risk from a muslim tactical vote were bethnal green  in east london  and rochdale in lancashire  he added. in bethnal green  former labour mp george galloway  who founded the anti-war party respect  is standing against sitting mp oona king  who had a 10 000-vote majority in 2001. in rochdale  the liberal democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 icm survey showed was benefiting most from muslim disaffection with labour - secured second place in the 2001 election  securing just under 6 000 votes fewer than labour s lorna fitzsimons. but professor curtice said the muslim anti-war vote could be split between the liberal democrats and respect  meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box.  ironically the tories might be the beneficiaries if labour does lose seats  which is generally the case   he said. but dr tamimi said mab s intention was not to  empower  the tories.  we know the next government will be labour  but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the muslims use their vote properly.  if the next labour government has a reduced majority that s a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country   dr tamimi said.
house prices suffer festive fall uk house prices fell 0.7% in december  according to figures from the office of the deputy prime minister.  nationally  house prices rose at an annual rate of 10.7% in december  less than the 13.7% rise the previous month. the average uk house price fell from £180 126 in november to £178 906  reflecting recent land registry figures confirming a slowdown in late 2004. all major uk regions  apart from northern ireland  experienced a fall in annual growth during december.  december is traditionally a quiet month for the housing market because of christmas celebrations. however  recent figures from the land registry - showing a big drop in sales between the last quarter of 2004 and the previous year - suggested the slowdown could be more than a seasonal blip. the volume of sales between october and december dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003  the land registry said. although both the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) and the land registry figures point to a slowdown in the market  the most recent surveys from nationwide and halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. after registering falls at the back-end of 2004  halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in january and nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year.
straw praises kashmir moves the uk has welcomed the decision by india and pakistan to open a bus link across the ceasefire line dividing the disputed region of kashmir.  foreign secretary jack straw  touring south east asian countries  praised the  spirit of cooperation  in achieving the breakthrough. media reports in both countries describe the deal as a major step in the ongoing peace process. mr straw said he hoped the agreement would make a difference to kashmiris. the bus service was one of several announcements made after a meeting of foreign ministers of both countries in islamabad on wednesday. kashmiri politicians on both sides of the line of control which divides the region welcomed the move.  in a statement  mr straw said the bus service between srinagar and muzaffarabad  will be able to reunite families that have been divided for decades .  this will make a real difference to the lives of kashmiris on both sides of the line of control   he said.  i warmly applaud the efforts of both india and pakistan to make this happen.  this spirit of cooperation will  i hope  lead to many more measures that will benefit all in the region.   on thursday mr straw was in india visiting sikhism s holiest shrine  the golden temple in amritsar where he tried his hand at making indian bread or roti. he is due to take part in talks with the indian government on friday. a second bus service linking the pakistani city of lahore with amritsar in india was also announced as well as a rail link between rajasthan state and pakistan s sindh province. both sides agreed to begin talks on reducing the risk of nuclear accidents and also said they planned to reopen their respective consulates in karachi and mumbai (bombay). the mountainous region of kashmir has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers for more than 50 years.
umbro profits lifted by euro 2004 uk sportswear firm umbro has posted a 222% rise in annual profit after sales of replica england football kits were boosted by the euro 2004 tournament.  pre-tax profit for 2004 was £15.4m ($29.4m). umbro  which recently lost sponsorship deals with chelsea and celtic  said on thursday it had signed a new four-year agreement with scottish club rangers. it hopes 2005 sales will benefit from the launch of a new england replica shirt ahead of the 2006 world cup. in january  umbro announced its sponsorship agreement with chelsea  which gave umbro the lucrative right to make replica shirts  would end in 2006  five years earlier than expected. the firm  which is to receive a payment from chelsea of £24.5m  said it is  appraising a number of additional investment opportunities as a result of this compensation  . chief executive peter mcguigan said the firm plans to grow sales both in the uk and internationally.  the firm  reporting its first annual results since listing on the london stock exchange in june  said the uk market had seen sales growth of 8% last year. it said the launch of its evolution x fashion range had boosted sales. umbro supplies more than 150 teams across the world including the national sides of ireland  sweden and norway. shares in umbro were up 1.76% at 115.5 pence in morning trade.
campbell to extend sprint career darren campbell has set his sights on running quicker than ever after deciding not to retire from sprinting.  campbell  who won olympic 4x100m relay gold  had been unsure about his future. but he told five live s sportsweek:  i had to get back into training before i could decide because if i didn t have the same hunger i d have to walk away.  i ve started back and i m thoroughly enjoying it. i m looking forward to it. i ve got to run under 10 seconds (for 100m) and under 20 seconds (for 200m).  campbell was part of the british quartet who shocked the americans to win relay gold in athens in august.  the newport-based athlete and team-mates jason gardener  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis were rewarded with mbes in the new year honours list. campbell s relay triumph made up for his disappointing displays in the individual 100m and 200m events in athens  when he failed to reach the finals. the 31-year-old  who won olympic 200m silver in sydney in 2000  said during the games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best.  he was criticised at the time by former olympic champion michael johnson  who cast doubt on campbell s injury claims.  to go to athens and finally get the gold i ve been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief   said campbell.  it was a chance for me to prove that if i d been fit i would have been challenging for the (individual) medals.  every season i go and challenge for the medals so why would last season have been any different   it s just unfortunate that i picked up that injury just before the olympics.  campbell set his 100m personal best of 10.04secs when he won the european title in budapest in 1998. and he ran 20.13secs in the quarter-finals of the 200m in sydney on the way to olympic silver.
worldcom director admits lying the former chief financial officer at us telecoms firm worldcom has admitted before a new york court that he used to lie to fellow board members.  speaking at the trial of his former boss bernard ebbers  scott sullivan said he lied to the board to cover up the hole in worldcom s finances. mr ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to worldcom s collapse in 2002. he pleads not guilty. the firm had been overstating its accounts by $11bn (£8.5bn). mr sullivan  42  has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following mr ebbers  trial  where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. mr ebbers  63  has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in worldcom s finances.  in the new york court on wednesday  mr ebbers  lawyer reid weingarten asked mr sullivan:  if you believe something is in your interest  you are willing and able to lie to accomplish it  isn t that right     on that date  yes. i was lying   replied mr sullivan. mr weingarten has suggested that mr sullivan is implicating mr ebbers only to win a lighter sentence  something mr sullivan denies. mr sullivan also rejects a suggestion that he had once told fellow worldcom board member bert roberts that mr ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at worldcom. the trial of mr ebbers is now into its third week.  under 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor  mr sullivan has previously told the court that he repeatedly warned mr ebbers that falsifying the books would be the only way to meet wall street revenue and earnings expectations. mr sullivan claims that mr ebbers refused to stop the fraud. mr ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. worldcom s problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies. prosecutors allege that the company s top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. worldcom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004  and is now known as mci.
brown outlines third term vision gordon brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of new labour s next general election bid.  he said ensuring every child in britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the nhs s creation. the chancellor has previously planned the party s election strategy but this time the role will be filled by alan milburn - a key ally of tony blair. the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labour s campaign  and praised his handling of the economy.  writing in the guardian newspaper  mr brown outlined his view of the direction new labour should be taking.  as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear  labour s ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance  disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education  good health and sustainable communities.  bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr brown s article was  a warning shot  to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process.  it was  as always  coded and careful... but entirely deliberate   was mr marr s assessment. the prime minister was asked about mr brown s article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio 4 s today programme. mr blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor s role would be  central . mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was  in part  because of mr brown s management of the economy. and he pledged childcare would be a  centrepiece  of labour s manifesto. he also predicted the next general election will be a  tough  tough fight  for new labour. but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 may. mr blair said he was taking  nothing for granted  ahead of the vote - warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour s majority instead of hoping for an outright win.
opposition grows to house arrests the conservatives have expressed  serious misgivings  about government plans for keeping uk and foreign terror suspects under house arrest.  michael howard said he would not back the home secretary s plans for  control orders  which include home detention.  i do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician   he said. the lib dems also oppose the proposals  but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.  the government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. new metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair has backed the control orders  saying:  i m sorry. it is a dilemma  but there is only one choice.  but mr howard said:  we have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the british way of life.   he argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. mr howard said he feared  internment without trial creates martyrs  and could be  a very effective recruiting sergeant  for terrorists . his party plans to move an amendment to the serious organised crime and police bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. he called on the prime minister to  enter into constructive discussions  with his party to find a  better way forward . controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the uk without trial or charge since december 2001 was freed from jail.  home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man  known only as c  certified as a terrorist suspect. on monday  the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. most of the terror suspects are detained at belmarsh prison in london. the liberal democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  it s a matter of principle for us that we can t have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals.   the lib dems believe the home secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions.  we think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging  surveillance  limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the home secretary s say so. that must be done with a proper judicial process  a judge involved in making those decisions   said mr oaten. mr clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. he said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in  serious  cases  with independent scrutiny from judges.
industrial revival hope for japan japanese industry is growing faster than expected  boosting hopes that the country s retreat back into recession is over.  industrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in january from a month earlier. at the same time  retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997. the news sent tokyo shares to an eight-month high  as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from april 2004 on. the nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11 740.60 points  with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen. weaker exports  normally the engine for japan s economy in the face of weak domestic demand  had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking gdp. only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. the output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials.  overall i see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession   said bank of japan chief toshihiko fukui  despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying.  within the overall industrial output figure  there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown. among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars  chemicals and electronic goods. with us growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand. electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market  with products such as flat-screen tvs in high demand during january.

candela completes bolton switch bolton boss sam allardyce has signed roma defender vincent candela on a five-month deal.  the 31-year-old former france international gave his last press conference as a roma player on monday  anouncing his move to bolton.  i have signed a five-month contract with bolton   said candela  who will travel to england on tuesday.  in june i will decide whether to continue to play for bolton or retire from professional football.  allardyce hopes candela s arrival will relieve bolton s injury crisis after defender nicky hunt limped out injured during oldham s 1-0 win against oldham in the fa cup on sunday.  in light of what has happened to nicky hunt  with his injury  it might be a blessing in disguise that we can bring in a highly-experienced full-back to help with our injuries at the back   allardyce said.  he has an outstanding pedigree in the game and has won honours at the highest level including the world cup in 1998.  he has not played regular football this year but is eager to impress in the premiership.  he can play in any position at the back and despite him being predominately right-footed he has played the majority of his career at left-back.  candela  who was a member of the roma side that won the title in 2001  has made only seven league appearances this season for luigi del neri s side.
security papers  found in street  an inquiry is under way after files containing security details about the pakistani president s visit to london were found by a member of the public.  the files are believed to contain detailed security arrangements for gen pervez musharraf s visit this week  including police codes. scotland yard said the policing operation had been reviewed. a spokesman said president musharraf s safety had not been compromised  as the papers had been handed in promptly.  we cannot discuss who was responsible for the documents  only that they contained the policing arrangements for the official visit   said the spokesman.  the papers are believed to have been found by a member of the public in a street in mayfair and given to the mirror newspaper. the police spokesman said the newspaper handed the report over on monday. the force s directorate of professional standards is investigating the circumstances surrounding the loss of the documents  he said. gen musharraf held talks with tony blair on monday. he arrived in britain on sunday night after flying from the united states  where he met president george w bush. he is due to visit the pakistani community in manchester on tuesday afternoon.
robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales.  robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates sunday s set-to with france at twickenham. lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems. and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat. olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour. the bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against france  with either tait or noon dropping out.  tait  given little opportunity to shine in attack  received praise from robinson afterwards  even if the coach admitted cardiff was an  unforgiving place  for the teenage prodigy. robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line  after just one outing  a player he regards as central to england s future. tait himself  at least outwardly  appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular.  i want more of that definitely   he said.  hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we ll have to look at the video and wait and see.  we were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. i thought we defended reasonably well but we ve just got to pick it up for france.   his newcastle team-mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test. he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build-up to wales  try  conceded a penalty at the breakdown  was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson s cross-kick into touch  all inside the first quarter. his contribution improved in the second half  but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. up front  the line-out remains fallible  despite a superb performance from chris jones  whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody. it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards  with andy hazell likely to make way. lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side  but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground.
mayor will not retract nazi jibe london mayor ken livingstone has again refused to retract a nazi insult made to a jewish reporter.  labour s mr livingstone  who says he is  standing by  his remarks  had accused an evening standard journalist of being like a  concentration camp guard . at his weekly press conference on tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. he said to media representatives:  if you think they are racist  i think you are wrong.  the mayor said his comments would not affect the 2012 olympic bid and added that his determination to stand up for what he believed in may impress bid chiefs  who arrived in london on tuesday.  i think it is important that the ioc (international olympic committee) members realise that when we get the games...they have a mayor who is not going to panic  change course or get in a great flap but will deliver the games on time and to budget   he said.  on tuesday  the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly. two motions were passed by the london assembly  which is made up of 25 members elected to examine the mayor s activities  on monday asking him to apologise and withdraw his comments. the mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of  examples of intrusion by journalists  into his  and his family s private life.  i don t suggest for one minute that has anything to do with the holocaust which was uniquely the most evil chapter in history.  but when reporters say to me i m only doing this because it s my job... that s the same abdication of moral responsibility at the thin end of the wedge that in its most extreme and horrific version ends up with others being prepared to stand as a concentration camp guard.   we are responsible for our own choices in this life  i always have been and so have reporters.  an official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the board of deputies of british jews  demanding an investigation by the standards board of england. it has the power to suspended or bar him from office but mr livingstone said:  there must have been 20 instances like this over the last 24 years.   i have never in response to any of that modified a policy i believed to be right or modified a position i believed to be right and i don t intend to now.  because if i do that effectively you hand power over your policies and position to the editors of papers.  on tape mr livingstone  who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper  is heard asking reporter oliver finegold if he is a  german war criminal . mr finegold replies:  no  i m jewish  i wasn t a german war criminal. i m quite offended by that.  the mayor then says:  ah right  well you might be  but actually you are just like a concentration camp guard  you are just doing it because you are paid to  aren t you
concerns over windows atms cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses  a security firm has warned.  the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines. already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system. but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small.  for many years the venerable ibm operating system  known as os/2  has been the staple software used to power many of the 1.4m cash machines in operation around the world. but ibm will end support for os/2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives. there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch  managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research.  he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay  mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data. us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways. todd thiemann  spokesman for anti-virus firm trend micro  said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks. mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that 70% of new cash machines being installed were windows based.  already  he said  there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them.  in january 2003 the slammer worm knocked out 13 000 cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce. in august of the same year  cash machines of two un-named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm. incidents like this happen  said mr thiemann  because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers. this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network.  this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system   he said.  banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network   mr thiemann told bbc news online.  but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year.  currently  he said  a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10% of all atms get swapped for a newer model every year.  windows cash machines have been around for several years   he said.  most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle.   in theory there is a bigger threat with windows than os/2   he said   but i do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment.   it s pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with atms   he said. the many different security systems built-in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously  he said. banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all  he added. a spokesman for the association of payment and clearing services (apacs) which represents the uk s payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal.  there s no concern that there s going to be any type of virus hitting the uk networks   he said. risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were a much smaller and tightly-knit community than in the us where viruses have struck.
pakistani women  must not hide  hiding women away in the home hidden behind veils is a backward view of islam  president musharraf of pakistan has said during a visit to britain.  he was speaking to the bbc s newsnight programme a few hours before visiting the pakistani community in manchester.  my wife is travelling around. she is very religious but she is very moderate   said general musharraf. it comes after pakistan s high commissioner to britain said some pakistanis should integrate more. dr maleeha lodhi said people could not expect others to listen to their grievances if they isolated themselves.  gen musharraf told the bbc:  some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out - absolutely wrong.  the pakistani president was also asked whether he thought the war on terror had made the world less safe.  yes  absolutely. and i would add that unfortunately we are not addressing the core problems  so therefore we can never address it in its totality   he said.  we are fighting it in its immediate context but we are not fighting it in its strategic long-term context.   it is the political disputes and we need to resolve them  and also the issue of illiteracy and poverty. this combined are breeding grounds of extremism and terrorism.  on monday the pakistani president met prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street  on his first official visit to london. he is due to visit the pakistani community in manchester on tuesday afternoon.  the mirror newspaper said on tuesday it had been handed a sensitive dossier outling the details of gen musharraf s visit to britain. the paper said the document had been found in a london street by a member of the public. it said the dossier contained details about his movements and also confidential police radio channels  call signs and codes. speaking in london on monday  gen musharraf said al-qaeda was  on the run  in pakistan.  but standing next to mr blair he added that it was crucial to tackle the  core of what creates terrorists  what creates an extremist  militant environment which then leads on to terrorism .  that is the resolution of political disputes.   mr blair said the two leaders had talked about afghanistan  the wider war on terror  the situation in the middle east and the ongoing dispute over kashmir.  we agreed that in afghanistan there is some cause for optimism about the progress that has been made there   said mr blair.  in respect of iraq  we agreed that whatever the issues of the past  the important thing now is to see the strategy through and ensure that iraq is capable of becoming a stable and democratic state.
nintendo adds media playing to ds nintendo is releasing an adapter for its ds handheld console so it can play music and video.  the add-on for the ds means people can download tv programmes  film clips or mp3 files to the adaptor and then play them back while on the move. the release of the media add-on is an attempt by the japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market. nintendo said the media adapter will be available from february in japan.  the nintendo ds is the successor to the hugely successful gameboy handheld game console and went on sale in japan on 2 december. the ds has two screens  one of which is touch sensitive  and also has on-board a short-range wireless link that lets people play against each other.  the launch of the media adapter  and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device  is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the sony psp which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start. sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the psp. the add-on will also work with the gameboy advance sp. nintendo dominates the handheld gaming console world thanks to successive versions of the gameboy. more than 28 million gameboy advance handhelds have been sold around the world. the dual-screen ds is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004. nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside japan. when it goes on sale the adapter is expected to cost about 5000 yen (£25)  roughly the difference in price between the ds and the higher-priced sony psp.
yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction a little-known russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant yukos at auction in moscow.  baikal finance group outbid favourite gazprom  the state-controlled gas monopoly  to buy yuganskneftegas. baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: £4.8bn) for yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn russia says yukos owes in taxes. yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and russian law  and said baikal had bought itself trouble.   the company considers that the victor of today s auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache   said yukos spokesman alexander shadrin. he said the company would continue to make  every lawful move  to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in yukos from  this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property . meanwhile  tim osborne  head of yukos main shareholders  group menatep  said that yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt  and that legal action would be taken  outside russia  against the auction winners. reports from russia say baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a sberbank (savings bank) account to the russian federal property fund  for yugansk.  the sale came despite a restraining order issued by a us court dealing with the firm s bankruptcy application for chapter 11 protection. yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but russian authorities argued they were imposing the law  trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. there were originally four registered bidders  and with its close ties to the kremlin  state-backed gas monopoly gazprom had been seen as favourite. but just two companies turned up for the auction  gazprom and the unknown baikal finance group  named after a large freshwater lake in siberia. and  according to tass news agency  gazprom did not make a single bid  leaving the way open for baikal  which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.  mystery firm baikal finance group is officially registered in the central russian region of tver  but many analysts believe it may be linked to gazprom. kaha kiknavelidze  analyst at troika dialog  said:  i think a decision that yugansk should end up with gazprom was taken a long time ago. so the main question was how to structure this transaction.   i would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and gazprom now has a partner.  i would also not exclude that baikal will decline to pay in 14 days  that are given by law  and gazprom is then recognised as the winner. this would give gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds.  another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price.  however  gazprom has announced it is not linked to baikal in any way. and paul collison  chief analyst at brunswick ubs  said:  i see no plausible explanation for the theory that baikal was representing competing interests.  yugansk will most likely end up with gazprom but could still end up with the government. there is still potential for surprises.  yugansk is at the heart of yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. the unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines. yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant  and had sought refuge in us courts.  the us bankruptcy court s initial order on thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to yukos filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  was upheld in a second ruling on saturday. the protection  if recognised by the russian authorities  would have allowed yukos  current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder  mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky is now in jail  on separate fraud charges. but president vladimir putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the bbc s sarah rainsford in moscow says most russians believe the destruction of yukos is now inevitable. hours before the auction lawyers for menatep  a group through which mr khodorkovsky and his associates control yukos  said they would take legal action in other countries. menatep lawyers  who were excluded from observing the auction  said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound russian oil and gas exports.
lit idol begins search for author the second pop idol-style search for literary talent has begun with the help of the brother of simon cowell.  writer tony cowell is among the judges who will hear aspiring writers read their work aloud. the winner gets a deal with literary agency curtis brown.  i m not going to be the mr nasty of books   said cowell  54  in reference to his brother s caustic remarks on tv shows pop idol and the x-factor. the 2004 winner  paul cavanagh  went on to sign a deal with harper collins.  this year  the competition is specifically looking for a crime writer. writers must submit up to 10 000 words from the opening chapters of their novels and a synopsis. professional readers will choose a shortlist of five following the competition closing date on 14 january.  the final five will then have to read their work in front of judging panel. a public vote will also take place  which will account for 25% of the final decision. the winner will be announced at the london book fair on 14 march next year and could be screened on tv.  it s very  very hard to find an agent and extremely difficult  without an agent  to get a publisher to look at your work   said cowell.  people do fall by the wayside and the more avenues we can provide for aspiring authors  the better   he added. paul cavanagh  a former university professor and health care consultant from ontario in canada  was one of 1 466 aspiring novelists to enter the first contest. he lifted the inaugural lit idol prize after reading aloud an excerpt of his work northwest passage. three film studios are said to be interested in buying film rights for the book  even though it is not finished yet.
tory backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards.  the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week s commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a  tough meeting  where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move  party sources told the bbc. the bill  which ministers claim will tackle crime  terrorism and illegal immigration  is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats.  they have said the scheme is  deeply flawed  and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been  agnostic  on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence  the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards  the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said.  it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.   lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.  the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it.  the new chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.
sainsbury s labour election gift science minister lord sainsbury has made a £2m donation to the labour party for its general election fund.  it is the latest hefty donation to the party by the billionaire - he has contributed more than £10m since 1999. david sainsbury said he was pleased to give cash to a party that had the  vision  to deliver economic prosperity and better public services for britain. general secretary matt carter said it was  a fantastic gift  that would help labour  fight and win the election .   through the generosity of david sainsbury and other labour supporters  labour will be campaigning hard to take britain forward and to stop the tories taking us back   mr carter said. lord sainsbury added:  i am pleased to be able to make this contribution to the general election funds of the labour party because i believe that they are the only party that has the vision to deliver both economic prosperity and better public services for britain.  the 64-year-old latest donation follows a £2.5m gift to the party in 2003. lord sainsbury was created a life peer in 1997  a year before he was appointed as minister for science.
peer-to-peer nets  here to stay  peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are here to stay  and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms  says a panel of industry experts.  once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year  firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology. the expert panel probed the future of p2p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january. the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music  movies and software. since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down  the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology  blaming it for falling sales and piracy. but that is going to change very soon  according to the panel.  the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content  said travis kalanick  founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh  and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. they are just waiting to come up with  business models  that work for them  which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards.  but  until the legal actions are resolved  experimentation with p2p cannot not happen  said michael weiss  president of streamcast networks. remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out  mr weiss said:  old media always tries to stop new media.  when they can t stop it  they try to control it. then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money.  once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology  the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. in august 2004  the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast  two file-sharing networks. the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle  and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal.  p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways. p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file  like photos  free software  licensed music and any other digital content. the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology. it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them. the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month  and about half a million films are downloaded a day. legal music download services  like apple itunes  napster  have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004  with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months  the ifpi reported this week. but such download services are very different from p2p networks  not least because of the financial aspect.  there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. paid-for-pass-along  in which firms receive money each time a file is shared  along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered.  we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p   said marc morgenstern  vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer.   consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together   agreed mr morgenstern. but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry s potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. unsigned bands  for example  use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively  which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign.  increasingly  what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content   said derek broes  from microsoft.  they will probably play an increasing role in helping p2p spread   he said. looking into p2p s future  file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks  as far as mr broes is concerned.  once some of these issues are resolved  you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content  but also in ways that are unimaginable now   he said.  file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.
anti-terror plan faces first test plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament.  tories  lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans. mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. opponents say only judges  not politicians  should be able to order detention of uk citizens. the government is expected to win wednesday s vote in the commons  but faces a battle in the house of lords.  the prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday. it proposes  control orders   which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases  and curfews  electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.  the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary  rather than a judge. tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice  like the guildford four - for which tony blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects.  those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that s why we have serious concerns abut that approach   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme.  mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at london s belmarsh prison. they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 march.  the new powers  designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords  concerns  would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects. critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days - wednesday and next monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords. but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently.  in a rare move  the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill  saying the house arrest plans are  excessive . it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan  wrongly infringes the right to liberty  by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. mr davis told today:  it gives a minister  for the first time in modern history  the right to detain without trial  without showing the evidence and indeed  in some respects  almost the allegation against the individual concerned.   he questioned why there was  such a rush  to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions  not politicians.  mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be  rash and negligent  to ignore their advice. nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the uk and its interests  he argued.
hi-tech posters guide commuters interactive posters are helping londoners get around the city during the festive season.  when interrogated with a mobile phone  the posters pass on a number that people can call to get information about the safest route home. sited at busy underground stations  the posters are fitted with an infra-red port that can beam information directly to a handset. the posters are part of transport for london s safe travel at night campaign.  the campaign is intended to help londoners  especially women  avoid trouble on the way home. in particular it aims to cut the number of sexual assaults by drivers of unlicensed minicabs. nigel marson  head of group marketing at transport for london (tfl)  said the posters were useful because they work outside the mobile phone networks.  they can work in previously inaccessible areas such as underground stations which is obviously a huge advantage in a campaign of this sort   he said.  the posters will automatically beam information to any phone equipped with an ir port that is held close to the glowing red icon on the poster.  we started with infra-red because there are a huge number ir phones out there   said rachel harker  spokeswoman for hypertag which makes the technology fitted to the posters.  it s a well established technology.  hypertag is also now making a poster that uses short-range bluetooth radio technology to swap data. although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number  ms harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images  ring tones and video clips. she said that there are no figures for how many people are using the posters but a previous campaign run for a cosmetics firm racked up 12 500 interactions.  before we ran a campaign there was a big question mark of:  if we build it will they come    she said.  now we know that  yes  they will.  the tfl campaign using the posters will run until boxing day.

roundabout continues nostalgia trip the new big-screen version of the magic roundabout  released in the uk on friday  is the latest attempt to turn children s television into box-office gold.  recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit s five children and it  previously filmed by the bbc in 1991. he-man and transformers  which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s  will soon receive their own costly makeovers. with screen versions of the a-team  the dukes of hazzard and even blake s seven on the cards  nostalgia is clearly big business. but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals. the new version of the magic roundabout  which will be released as sprung! in the us  replaces the stop-motion models of the 1960s tv show with polished  computer-generated animation.  in a similar fashion  the 2004 thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original s puppets and models. the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences. pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout  while the now-defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song. but while some reviewers have been won over  there has nonetheless been a significant backlash.  this cg-animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stop-motion roundabout a cult hit   writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site.  and the recent puppet comedy team america: world police was in part provoked by its directors  outrage that gerry anderson s thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins. dan jolin  reviews editor of empire magazine  says classic children s tv shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.   i can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today.  but i think it s backfiring. what s next - the clangers on some distant planet  with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them   despite thunderbirds  disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating. it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment.  after the success of garfield: the movie  britain s shabby tabby  surely deserves his own film vehicle. with only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series  there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat  professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ.  furry recyclers  have already had one big-screen outing - 1977 s wombling free. but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback. advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbc s supernatural comedy  . and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tv s most popular cartoon buccaneer   . it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed.  the magic roundabout is out in the uk on 11 february.    how about bringing catweazle to the big screen  he could give gandalf a run for his money!  thundercats!! i loved it. should be fun to see on the big screen  if some effort is put in! it will bring my youth back!  get your hands off the clangers! is nothing sacred   make a movie version of the banana splits!  what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops  or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy.  you forgot to mention the grearest of them all  danger mouse! but then again  it couldn t be better than the original series  could it   it s always nice to see these old toons re-released  but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song!) i think i ve been completely put off. just leave these classics alone as good memories.  i think remakes are a good idea. as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe. i believe this is the whole reason  retro  has become so popular. as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series. personally i d like to see cartoons such as transformers  thundercats and m.a.s.k. get full hollywood remakes.  leave them alone  why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place  the thunderbirds film was apalling  not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson.  love to see transformers with real actors and cgi. and make it at least a 15 rating.  part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect. they were moody  sarcastic  and rather human. just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved. dougal never smiled like that! films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing  and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.  i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film. it s got all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story. bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two.  it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a  new  audience  but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this  and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it. it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice  but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood  they are never going to live up to expectation. it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made  are film-makers running out of original ideas   all i can say is bring back danger mouse  probably the greatest kids  show ever. i recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a child.  there was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back. again  like so many of these nostalgia programmes  the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original s cut out paper technique for inventiveness  and was woefully inadequate. we live in a sampling world - the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration  clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new. seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them  rather than being daring and trying something new.  it got to be mr.benn. the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop  steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing! if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great. and who to play the lead role  well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin. if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character.  muffin the mule perhaps   after all  grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know!  why can t the british film industry try making gerry anderson s ufo or captain scarlet  or saphire and steel  or the tomorrow people.  in today s media  it seems the past is the future. tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes  dj s are sampling or re-working 70 s and 80 s music. even computer games from 10-15 years ago are getting modern re-workings. personally  i think it shows that no one has any originality any more! why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone.  mary  mungo and midge. but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs. plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block  yeah but no but i wasn t even there!  i d like to see mr. benn  with brad pitt in the title role. sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner.  it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia. there are plany of modern children s book that would make excellent films or tv programmes  why not use them instead of rehashing the past   mr. benn with rowan atkinson as the lead.  would have loved to see dungeons & dragons made  but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn t come up to scratch. the only one that isn t to be remade as yet is thundercats  which i d like to see.  i m an expat living in norway  and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite children s programs for my 2 daughters. my dearest wish  however  is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen!! very scandinavian...  rainbow!  i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone  and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office  especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie  popular among children because it s original  witty  and modern. the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.  how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies  rentaghost  terrahawks  bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!!  if a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then i ll be the first one on amazon buying a copy  eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch. repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price! i don t care! till then i ll have to make do with the citreon c4 advert.  i d luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same. and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden  superb children s programme. could morph hold his own in a big screen movie    or even jamie and the magic torch....hmmmmm  i could go on and on. danger mouse  at 34 i m showing my age. :-)  noggin the nog was one of the best children s programs. the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach oliver postgate s wonderful voices. so in general leave well alone. the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story.  just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy  yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like fingermouse  bob the builder  postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire  post and bricks. in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns  krusty and gobo. will they triumph or will they fail miserably  find out this fall.  one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe 90. it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe s car. of course  gerry anderson s supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen  big-budget action. it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a children t movie that really let it down. after all  the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves.  it s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods  isn t it  i d hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation - i love that  done in a shed  clunkiness and you couldn t recreate the magic. perhaps if the remakes were done in a  look around you  mock-authentic style i might be interested ...  chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch; that would be mega!  this re-gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people s ideas  because it guarantees to bring in the $$$. the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material  will young etc. the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short-term. the fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant (e.g. starsky & hutch) hence  the market is saturated with this mindless drivel  but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it!  i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies. i m only 27 and don t remember the series from when it was on tv  but have the set on dvd and it s a classic. the fact it s so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today s stuff it looks amateurish. thats the appeal though  it s so innocent (like chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.
gaming firm to sell uk dog tracks six uk greyhound tracks have been put up for sale by gaming group wembley as part of a move which will lead to the break-up of the group.  wembley announced the planned sale as it revealed it was to offload its us gaming division to blb investors. us gaming consortium blb will pay $339m (£182.5m) for the us unit  although the deal is subject to certain conditions. blb holds a 22% stake in wembley and last year came close to buying the whole firm in a £308m takeover deal. shares in wembley were up 56 pence  or 7.6%  at 797p by mid-morning.  the sale of the us gaming unit will leave wembley with its uk business. this includes greyhound tracks at wimbledon in london  belle vue in manchester  perry barr and hall green in birmingham  oxford and portsmouth. analysts have valued the six tracks at between £40m-£50m. the us business accounts for about 90% of wembley s operating profit and consists of operations in rhode island and colorado. blb s purchase of the us unit is subject to the agreement of a revenue-sharing deal being struck with rhode island authorities. wembley said that  once the deal was completed  it anticipated returning surplus cash to shareholders.  whilst the completion of the sale of the us gaming division remains subject to a number of conditions  we believe this development is a positive step towards the maximisation of value for shareholders   said wembley chairman claes hultman. wembley sold the english national football stadium in 1999 to concentrate on its gaming operations.
wenger signs new deal arsenal manager arsene wenger has signed a new contract to stay at the club until may 2008.  wenger has ended speculation about his future by agreeing a long-term contract that takes him beyond the opening of arsenal s new stadium in two years. he said:  signing a new contract just rubber-stamps my desire to take this club forward and fulfil my ambitions.  i still have so much to achieve and my target is to drive this club on. these are exciting times for arsenal.   the 55-year-old frenchman told arsenal s website www.arsenal.com:  my intention has always been clear. i love this club and am very happy here.  wenger has won the title and the fa cup three times each during his reign. chairman peter hill-wood said:  we are absolutely delighted that arsene has signed an extension to his contract.  since his arrival in 1996  he has revolutionised the club both on and off the pitch.  as well as the six major honours he s won during his time here  arsene has been a leading influence behind all the major initiatives at the club including the construction of our new training centre and also our new stadium.   the club has continued to reap the benefits of arsene s natural eye for unearthing footballing talent.  we currently have a fantastic crop of young players coming through the ranks together with a number of world-class players who are playing a wonderful brand of football.  meanwhile  arsenal director danny fiszman is looking for wenger to stay beyond 2008.  when we come towards the end of his contract we will both review the situation. i m sure we will want him to stay on and i hope he will too   said fiszman.
howard rebuts asylum criticisms tory leader michael howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.  mr howard  whose parents fled the nazi threat to come to the uk  says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. his comments come in a bbc documentary called  no more mr nasty . tv presenter anne robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would  like to kick your cat . ms robinson  a friend of the tory leader  also revealed that as a cambridge student mr howard was  much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover  - although she denied having personal experience.  i wasn t at cambridge - and it s not personal experience - but i know people who were.   documentary maker michael cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to mr howard for his film portrait. the tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s  his parents might not have been allowed into the country.  he replies:  what is the inference of that   that if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you re not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants   that seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition  it would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.   ms robinson  who presents the weakest link tells cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in john major s government.  i used to have to sit on my hands because he d get on television and give a passable impression of someone who d like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. i mean it was very  very draconian.  the film shows mr howard laughing at rory bremner s impression of him as dracula  which he calls  good fun   apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the uk. the film shows the private side of the tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife  ex-model sandra. asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses:  yeah  it would be more enjoyable if i could win occasionally too  but otherwise it s quite fun.   former downing street communications chief alastair campbell  now working on labour s election campaign  says a  touchy-feely  image does not fit mr howard. he says tony blair was not worried by his opponents  early performance in their commons clashes because mr howard lacked a  big strategy   including on issues like iraq. the tory leader brands such criticisms as  absolutely rubbish   arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of mr blair s failure to tell the truth on intelligence. former tory chancellor ken clarke says mr howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the tory party than his personal image. mr clarke says the party is improving and it is  conceivable  it could win the next election. but he adds:  it has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.   - michael howard: no more mr nasty is being shown on bbc2 on saturday 12 february at 2005 gmt.
us duo in first spam conviction a brother and sister in the us have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to aol subscribers.  it is the first criminal prosecution of internet spam distributors. jurors in virginia recommended that the man  jeremy jaynes  serve nine years in prison and that his sister  jessica degroot  be fined $7 500. they were convicted under a state law that bars the sending of bulk e-mails using fake addresses.  they will be formally sentenced next year. a third defendant  richard rutkowski  was acquitted. prosecutors said jaynes was  a snake oil salesman in a new format   using the internet to peddle useless wares  news agency associated press reported. a  fed-ex refund processor  was supposed to allow people to earn $75 an hour working from home. another item on sale was an  internet history eraser . his sister helped him process credit card payments. jaynes amassed a fortune of $24m from his sales  prosecutors said.  he s been successful ripping people off all these years   ap quoted prosecutor russell mcguire as saying. jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100 000 e-mails in 30 days  virginia state attorney general jerry kilgore reportedly said. prosecutors had asked for 15 years in jail for jaynes  and a jail term for his sister. but jaynes  lawyer david oblon called the nine-year recommended term  outrageous  and said his client believed he was innocent. he pointed out that all three of the accused lived in north carolina and were unaware of the virginia state law. spam messages are estimated to account for at least 60% of all e-mails sent.
school tribute for tv host carson more than 1 000 people turned out on sunday to pay tribute to late us tv presenter johnny carson in the nebraska town where he grew up.  carson  who hosted the tonight show for 30 years  died on 23 january from respiratory disease emphysema. he lived in norfolk  nebraska from the age of eight until he joined the navy  but returned regularly and donated $5m (£2.7m) to local causes. old school friends were among the crowd at the school s johnny carson theater.  carson  who was one of the best-loved tv personalities in the us  asked not to have a public memorial in los angeles  where he lived in later life. he began his showbusiness career in norfolk  performing magic under the name the great carsoni from the age of 14. his donations included $600 000 to norfolk high school in the 1980s to build a new performing arts centre. when carson died  president bush led the public tributes  saying the presenter  had a profound influence on american life and entertainment .
online commons to spark debate online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust  says the institute of public policy research (ippr).  existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services  says the think-tank. although the net is becoming part of local and central government  its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online  commons  for public debate. in its report  is online community a policy tool   the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities. adopting an ebay-type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection.  what we are proposing is a civic commons   will davies  senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website.  a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication - like a pre-legislation discussion.   the idea of a  civic commons  was originally proposed by stephen coleman  professor of e-democracy at the oxford internet institute. the ippr report points to informal  small scale examples of such commons that already exist. it mentions good-practice public initiatives like the bbc s ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues.  but he adds  government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too. proposals for id cards  for instance  could also be widened to see if they could be used online. they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online.  at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services   said mr davies.  but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities.  the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each other s reputation by how they treat other members. using a similar mechanism  trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built. this could mean a civic commons would work within a non-market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly-recognised rules.  e-government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web. many online communities  such as chatrooms  mailing lists  community portals  message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues.  with 53% of uk households now with access to the net  the government  suggests mr davies  could act as an intermediary or  middleman  to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more  cosmopolitan politics  and public trust in policy.  government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online.  but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic  non-market interactions   said mr davies. there is a role for public bodies like the bbc  libraries  and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of  cliques  talking to each other  he added. the paper is part of the ippr s digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain.
cabinet anger at brown cash raid ministers are unhappy about plans to use whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down  local government minister nick raynsford has acknowledged.  gordon brown reallocated £512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-budget report on thursday. mr raynsford said he had held some  pretty frank discussions  with fellow ministers over the plans. but he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises.  the central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in england keep next year s council tax rises below 5%  in what is likely to be a general election year.  mr raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities. and he confirmed rows over the issue with ministerial colleagues.  obviously we had some pretty frank discussions about this   he told bbc radio 4 s the world at one. but he said there was a recognition that  a good settlement for local government  was important to health  education and  other government departments . ministers had to be sure local government could deliver without  unreasonable council tax increases   he added. mr raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election.   this is a response to the concerns that have been voiced by local government about the pressures they face.  mr raynsford also plans to make savings of £100m by making changes to local government pensions schemes. these would raise the age from which retiring workers could claim their pensions and limit how much they received if they retired early. he insisted the changes were  very modest  and designed to tackle the problem of workers retiring  very early . but general secretary of the public services union unison dave prentis criticised the plans.  if you want world class public services you don t get that by hitting people as they approach retirement.
us crude prices surge above $53 us crude prices have soared to fresh four-month highs above $53 in the us as refinery problems propelled petrol prices to an all-time high.  us light sweet crude futures jumped to $53.09 a barrel in new york before closing at $53.03. the gains tracked a surge in us gasoline futures to a record high of $1.4850 a gallon. the jump followed a fire at western refining company s refinery in texas  which shut down petrol production. a spokesman for the group was unable to say when the production unit would be back up and running.  this market simply wants to go up   citigroup global markets analyst kyle cooper told reuters news agency. ed silliere  analyst at energy merchant  added:  gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in texas  which means there will be a scramble for product in the (us) gulf coast.   elsewhere  a refinery in houston was closed due to mechanical problems  while on tuesday production at bp s texas city refinery was taken down for a short time. in the approach to spring  the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season. the rise in prices came despite a us government report that showed domestic supplies of fuel oil and fuel were rising. meanwhile  oil production cartel opec s recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market. oil prices are roughly 45% higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather  the declining value of the dollar and fears that opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand. instability in iraq and underlying fears about terrorism have also played a part in the rally.
bell set for england debut bath prop duncan bell has been added to england s 30-man squad to face ireland in the rbs six nations.  and with phil vickery sidelined for at least six weeks with a broken arm and julian white out with a neck injury  bell could make his england debut. bell  30  had set his sights on an international career with wales. but last december  the international rugby board confirmed that he could only be eligible for england as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. england coach andy robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row. but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped bell - who was among the tryscorers when england a beat france a 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in. robinson also has an injury worry over centre olly barkley  who withdrew from bath s starting line-up to face gloucester last weekend.  he was due to have a hospital scan on monday  while gloucester centre henry paul  who started at fly-half against bath  limped out at kingsholm because of an ankle problem. despite barkley s three missed penalties in the 18-17 defeat against france  he is expected to retain his place at inside centre  although leicester s in-form prospect ollie smith would be an obvious replacement. bath coach john connolly rates barkley as no better than a 50/50 chance to make the dublin trip. uncapped fly-half andy goode has been named in a 30-man training squad for the ireland game  and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during leicester s record 83-10 win against newcastle on sunday. england s players are due to meet at their surrey training base on monday.
china net cafe culture crackdown chinese authorities closed 12 575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004  the country s government said.  according to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally. chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. the move is the latest in a series of steps the chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use.  the official xinhua news agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a  safer environment for young people in china . rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools. the hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated. china has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people. the 12 575 cafes were shut in the three months from october to december. china also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to.  net cafes are hugely popular in china because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have pcs in their homes. this is not the first time that the chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines. all the 100 000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see. logs of sites people visit are also kept. laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. during the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate. in august 2004 chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn. at the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites. the reporters without borders group said in a report that chinese government technologies for e-mail interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world.
blog reading explodes in america americans are becoming avid blog readers  with 32 million getting hooked in 2004  according to new research.  the survey  conducted by the pew internet and american life project  showed that blog readership has shot up by 58% in the last year. some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the us presidential campaign. despite the explosive growth  more than 60% of online americans have still never heard of blogs  the survey found. blogs  or web logs  are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts  opinions or spread news events in their own words. companies such as google and microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs.  the rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information  with six million americans now using rss aggregators. rss aggregators are downloaded to pcs and are programmed to subscribe to feeds from blogs  news sites and other websites. the aggregators automatically compile the latest information published online from the blogs or news sites. reading blogs remains far more popular than writing them  the survey found. only 7% of the 120 million us adults who use the internet had created a blog or web-based diary. getting involved is becoming more popular though  with 12% saying they had posted material or comments on other people s blogs.  just under one in 10 of the us s internet users read political blogs such as the daily kos or instapundit during the us presidential campaign. kerry voters were slightly more likely to read them than bush voters. blog creators were likely to be young  well-educated  net-savvy males with good incomes and college educations  the survey found. this was also true of the average blog reader  although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities. the survey was conducted during november and involved telephone surveys of 1 324 internet users.
nortel in $300m profit revision telecoms equipment maker nortel networks has sharply revised downwards its profits for the 2003 fiscal year.  in a long-awaited filing  nortel said it had made $434m (£231m)  compared to the previously reported $732m. but the figures - revised after an audit which led to the sacking of the canadian firm s chief - showed revenue was about 4% higher than first thought. nortel shares  which have lost nearly 50% of their value since last year  climbed 1.46% in toronto on tuesday. nortel s head frank dunn and two other executives were fired in january last year after the company announced it had conducted the internal audit. securities and police authorities in both the us and canada are still conducting inquiries into the accounts.  nortel also issued new figures for the 2001-2002 period  which they had previously indicated had understated losses.  with the completion of our restatements we have a solid foundation on which to move forward with our business   said nortel president and chief executive bill owens.  the restatement has been a monumental task  both complex and demanding.  the company also said 12 senior executives - none of whom were involved directly in the accounting of the revised figures - have voluntarily agreed to repay to bonuses awarded in 2003 totalling $8.6m. nortel added:  these members of the core executive team share the board s deep disappointment over the circumstances that led to the restatement.
msps hear renewed climate warning climate change could be completely out of control within several decades  the scottish environment protection agency is warning a committee of msps.  experts are giving evidence on the subject to the scottish parliament s environment committee. officials believe nuclear energy and wind farms may be better options than trying to tackle global warming. solutions suggested by conservationists include reducing internal uk air travel and boosting electric trains. the evidence is part of the committee s inquiry into the impact of climate change in scotland. sepa is attempting to curb global warming gases  as pollution from transport emissions increases.  ecologists are warning msps that scotland may have to accept  significant intrusion  from wind farms. it is likely also that nuclear power will be needed for possibly several decades. sepa predict that the two methods will remain as energy sources until climate change is under control. experts studying the seas off scotland s west coast have already forecast more devastating weather of the type which caused havoc across the country last month.  they predicted that damaging storms will become more frequent. researchers from the university of the highlands and islands and southampton have been looking at wave heights in the atlantic over the last nine years. the project was conducted jointly by the environmental research institute in thurso  which is part of the university of the highlands and islands (uhi) millennium institute network  and the southampton oceanography centre. scientists carried out a series of studies  including the use of satellites to assess wave heights in the seas around the west coast and the hebrides.
call to save manufacturing jobs the trades union congress (tuc) is calling on the government to stem job losses in manufacturing firms by reviewing the help it gives companies.  the tuc said in its submission before the budget that action is needed because of 105 000 jobs lost from the sector over the last year. it calls for better pensions  child care provision and decent wages. the 36-page submission also urges the government to examine support other european countries provide to industry. tuc general secretary brendan barber called for  a commitment to policies that will make a real difference to the lives of working people.    greater investment in childcare strategies and the people delivering that childcare will increases the options available to working parents   he said.  a commitment to our public services and manufacturing sector ensures that we can continue to compete on a global level and deliver the frontline services that this country needs.  he also called for  practical measures  to help pensioners  especially women who he said  are most likely to retire in poverty . the submission also calls for decent wages and training for people working in the manufacturing sector.
china  ripe  for media explosion asia is set to drive global media growth to 2008 and beyond  with china and india filling the two top spots  analysts have predicted.  japan  south korea and singapore will also be strong players  but china s demographics give it the edge  a media conference in london heard. the world s most populous country - population 1.3bn - now has about 200 million middle-class consumers. forty per cent fall in the key 16 to 35-year-old demographic. as a result  it is attracting huge foreign investment in media and communications  analysts told the financial times new media and broadcasting conference last week. interest in china among international media groups has surged in recent months after beijing issued rules allowing foreign investment in joint-venture television  radio and film production companies. news corporation  viacom and sony pictures are among the big names involved in joint ventures with chinese players.  more than 700 million chinese listen to 1 000 radio stations  while 200 tv stations broadcast 2 900 channels. china central television (cctv)  the state broadcaster  claims an audience of more than a billion people. of the country s 360 million households  100 million receive cable tv programmes. the rest could be a potential audience for satellite broadcasting which china plans to launch in 2006. the state administration of radio  film and television (sarft)  which regulates broadcasting  plans to move all programmes to digital by 2015. the continuing roll-out of new digital channels has boosted demand for quality content  creating significant opportunities for both chinese and foreign content providers.  but according to recent reports from china  the authorities have tightened controls over foreign investment in tv production joint ventures. it has limited most foreign companies to only one joint venture and banned the involvement of any found to be  unfriendly   according to reports. the sarft said:  there is a very strong ideological component to production of broadcast television programmes.  it added:  china must understand the political tendencies and background of overseas partners and prevent joint ventures or cooperation from bringing harmful foreign thinking or culture into our production sector.  according to the financial times  china correspondent  the new rules highlight the political sensitivities that surround foreign involvement in china s media sector. this is despite beijing s decision to open the state-dominated sector to international investment.  as well as traditional broadcasting  chinese and foreign entrepreneurs alike see fortunes waiting to be made in new media  like mobile services and online gaming. mobile games already account for 15% of revenues from china s 340 million mobile users.  online gaming sales are predicted to top a billion us dollars next year  according to the uk-based journal screen digest. the video market is also seen as a big opportunity  although piracy levels are still very high despite an anti-piracy drive during the past year. in the cinema industry the deployment of digital screens is being accelerated. this is not just to modernise venues but also to curb piracy and regulate distribution. li ruigang  president of the commercial broadcaster shanghai media group  told the conference that china s new media market  is already experiencing explosive growth . it was particularly strong in charged broadband services and mobile value-added services. leading china-watcher  and founder of the cga consultancy jeanne-marie gescher  agreed that the time was ripe for foreign media groups to tap china s huge media market potential.  china s media are now driven by investors who do not care how people consume media - they just want people to consume more of it   mrs gescher concluded.
format wars could  confuse users  technology firms sony  philips  matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.  the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different  and conflicting  content control systems  experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.  currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system  the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy  appropriately licensed video and music on any device  independent of how they originally obtained that content . the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music  movies and other digital content they have bought. called the marlin joint development association  the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium.  the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft. confusingly for consumers  the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple.  in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats  such as betamax and vhs  that consumers have seen in the past   said ian fogg  personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research.  the difference is that it is very fragmented   he said.  it s not a two-horse race  it s a five  six  seven or even eight-horse race  mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families. although initiatives such as microsoft s  plays for sure  program could help remove some of the uncertainty  he said  life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.  shelley taylor  analyst and author of a report about online music services  said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. apple s itunes service was a perfect example of this  she said.  although itunes has been hugely successful  apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods   she said.  she said rampant competition between online music services  of which there are now 230 according to recent figures  could drive more openness and freer file formats.  it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run   she said   and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.  ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop.  people want portability   she said   and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.  cory doctorow  european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues  expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims.  not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying   he said. he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. instead  said mr doctorow  drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers.  the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version  the auto version  the american and uk version  the ringtone version  and so on.
us trade deficit widens sharply the gap between us exports and imports has widened to more than $60bn (£31.7bn)  an all-time record.  figures from the commerce department for november showed exports down 2.3% to $95.6bn  while imports grew 1.3% to $155.8bn on rising consumer demand. part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports. but the numbers suggested the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact  and could indicate slowing economic growth.  the trade deficit - far bigger than the $54bn widely expected on wall street - prompted a rapid response from the currency markets.  by 1650 gmt  the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280  almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement. against the pound  the dollar was down about 0.7% at $1 8923.  the dollar s fall has been sudden  violent and appropriate given this number   said brian taylor of wells fargo in minneapolis.  recent exchange rate movements certainly haven t had any impact yet.  treasury secretary john snow put a brave face on the news  saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion.  the economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income... some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners.   although the white house officially still backs the us s traditional  strong dollar  policy  it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued. the dollar has fallen by 50% against the euro - as well as by 30% against the yen - in the past three years. the main catalyst  most economists accept  is the large budget deficit on the one hand  and the current account deficit - the difference between the flow of money in and out of the us - on the other. the trade deficit is a large part of the latter. in november  the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals  as well as of cars  consumer goods and food. one small bright spot for us policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with china  often blamed for job losses and other economic woes. although china s overall trade surplus is expanding  according to chinese government figures  the commerce department revealed the us s deficit with china was $19.6bn in november  down from $19.7bn the month before. but the deficit with japan was at its worst in more than four years.
no re-draft  for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps.  the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions  while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review  all aspects of the directive . the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect  in other words   computer implemented invention .  in a letter  ec president jos&#233; manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament  josep borrell  that the commission  did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council (of ministers)  as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004.  if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament. but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law. french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament s request it would be an  insult  to the assembly. he said that the parliament would then reject the council s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted.  this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its  one-click shopping  service  for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this  they fear  could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.
casino royale is next bond movie casino royale  author ian fleming s first james bond book  is to be the next bond film  with goldeneye director martin campbell behind the camera.  it will be the 21st james bond film to hit the big screen  and speculation has been rife over who will play the lead. casino royale was turned into a spoof spy movie by john huston in 1967  with david niven in the lead role. pierce brosnan led the past four bond films but said producers axed him after offering him the chance to return. among the favourites to take over the coveted role are scottish actor dougray scott  oscar nominee clive owen and australian star hugh jackman. producers say no decision has yet been made on who will become the seventh actor  including niven  to play bond on film. kill bill director quentin tarantino had talked of wanting to take on the casino royale project  and said he had spoken to brosnan about it.  shooting on casino royale is expected to begin once campbell has finished work on the legend of zorro  a sequel to the mask of zorro  starring catherine zeta jones and antonio banderas. producers barbara broccoli and michael g wilson expect the film to be released in 2006.  the script will once again be developed by neal purvis and robert wade who have both worked on two previous bond movies. fleming s book saw the introduction of bond pitted against a russian spy in a game of baccarat. simultaneously  a woman arrives on the scene to take his eye off the game. the novel is one of fleming s most violent and sadistic stories  with 007 suffering a savage beating from his nemesis le chiffre. in addition to the 1967 film  it was also adapted for television in 1954 with actor barry nelson as an americanised  jimmy  bond. mgm vice chairman chris mcgurk said:  martin (campbell) is an incredibly exciting film-maker. goldeneye was a wonderful movie and helped reinvigorate the bond franchise. we re thrilled to have him back to direct the newest bond.  new zealand-born campbell moved to the uk in 1966 and directed tv series such as the professionals  minder and bergerac. his film credits include edge of darkness  vertical limit and beyond borders  which starred angelina jolie and clive owen.

potter director signs warner deal harry potter director alfonso cuaron has signed a three-year deal with hollywood studio warner brothers  according to variety trade magazine.  the mexican film-maker  who directed harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  will produce mainstream movies and smaller spanish-language films.  we had a wonderful experience with alfonso on harry potter   warner producer jeff robinov told variety. cuaron s other films include mexican movie y tu mama tambien.  the 2001 rites-of-passage drama about two teenage boys who embark on a relationship with an older woman  brought cuaron international attention - and box office glory.  it also won him and his brother carlos  with whom he co-wrote the screenplay  an oscar nomination for best original screenplay. warner will distribute cuaron s films in several languages outside the us.  this deal will give us the opportunity to collaborate with alfonso on movies that make the most of his artistry and vision  and continue to offer him the mainstream worldwide audiences that our studio provides so successfully   said mr robinov.  his first film for warner brothers was 1995 s family fantasy movie a little princess. based on the novel by frances hodgson burnett  a little princess tells the story of a young girl who is sent to live in a new york boarding school when her widowed father enlists for war. after the erotic nature of y tu mama tambien  cuaron was a surprise choice to direct the third harry potter film but his dark interpretation was received well by the public and critics alike.
italy to get economic action plan italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country s sputtering economy on thursday night in rome.  he will present an  action plan for the development of italy  in a meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders. mr berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (r&d) spending  and the competitiveness of small firms. also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system. the prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 gmt.  the government has been accused of underfunding r&d  making it harder for italy to compete with other european nations and leading to a  brain-drain  of the country s brightest talents. analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive  hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. as a result  they say  italy s corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. at the same time  bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts  a situation that is hampering italy s entrepreneurial spirit.  the government says that it has set about tackling the problems  adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of italy s 60 million population. according to il sole 24 ore  italy s business newspaper  the government will focus on  opening up markets  infrastructure  research  making more incentives available  bankruptcy law  the slow pace of the justice system .  mr berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; £4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend. he has also promised to cap spending on transport  education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit. italy plans to raise as much as 25bn euros from privatisations in 2005  including a partial flotation of the post office and utility enel. critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make italy s problems worse. limiting government spending will lead to job losses  they counter  while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy.  the country has been one of the eurozone s worst economic performers in recent years. growth was 1.1% in 2004  up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. at the same time  business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards. without a pick up in national growth  they say  the money could eventually run out  bringing italy s economy to a juddering halt. consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of italy s economy.
oscars steer clear of controversy the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer  less contentious cinema.  if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches  two of the front-runners would have had to be michael moore s bush-baiting documentary fahrenheit 9/11 and mel gibson s the passion of the christ. both films polarised opinion but had critics talking  and the public turning up to see them - fahrenheit 9/11 breaking us box office records for a documentary  and the passion of the christ making more than us$370m (£196m) in the us alone. but this year s academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies  with the passion of the christ - a film accused of being anti-semitic - receiving nominations only in the  minor  categories of cinematography  makeup and musical score.  fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked  despite winning the palme d or at the cannes international film festival in 2004.  moore s caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors  decision to enter it in the best picture category  rather than best documentary  says tim dams  the news editor of trade magazine screen international. but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moore s film does not sit well with the academy.  if you look at past oscar winners and nominees  the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative  epic-style pictures. fahrenheit 9/11 didn t really fit in to that category.  they tend to go for films like titanic  gladiator  and the lord of the rings  films with scale that often aren t too contentious   he said. while he said the oscar voting panel were not  snubbing  moore s film  he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category.  i think it s more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub   he said.  the problem with mel gibson s film  he believed  was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic  an ancient middle eastern language.   hollywood doesn t tend to like foreign-language films - no-one s ever tried doing a film in a dead language   he said. but aside from these two films  some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. the german film the downfall  a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker  has been recognised in the best foreign film category. the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man  rather than a semi-mythical  historical monster. but mr dams said:  it s not an inflammatory film. it has done very well in germany  and it s a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster.  another  contentious  film  mr dams said  has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.  independent film-maker morgan spurlock may have forced fast-food giant mcdonalds to withdraw its  super size  portions in the us after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals - and filmed his progress.  the film has been a hit around the world. mr dams said:  it s a political film  but it s quite fun and punky and well-paced.  morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy. it s a very accessible film  and it doesn t beat you over the head with its views.  while in fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy  i think the way that super size me is put together - the fact it s a very likeable film - means it s won through on charm.  dam s pick at this year s oscars  the aviator  martin scorsese s biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes. tinseltown  it seems  likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.
shares rise on new man utd offer shares in manchester united closed up 4.75% on monday following a new offer from us tycoon malcolm glazer.  the board of the football club is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal  which values the club at £800m ($1.5bn). manchester united revealed on sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from mr glazer  which looks set to receive more serious scrutiny. the club has previously rejected mr glazer s approaches out of hand. but a senior source at the club told the bbc:  this time it s different.  supporters  group shareholders united  however  urged the club to reject the new deal.  a spokesman for the shareholders united said:  i can t see any difference (compared to mr glazer s previous proposals) other than £200m less debt.  he isn t bringing any money into the club; he ll use our money to buy it.   mr glazer s latest move is being led by mr glazer s two sons  avi and joel  according to the financial times. a proposal was received by david gill  united s chief executive  at the end of last week  pitched at about 300p a share. david cummings  head of uk equities for standard life investments  said he believed a  well funded  300p a share bid would be enough for mr glazer to take control of the club.   i do not think there is anything that manchester united fans can do about it   he told the bbc.  they can complain about it but it is curtains for them. they may not want him but they are going to get him.  the us tycoon  who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months  has approached the united board with  detailed proposals   it has confirmed.  mr glazer  who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team  hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. he is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal  though it is not clear by how much. for his proposal to succeed  he needs the support of united s largest shareholders  the irish horseracing tycoons jp mcmanus and john magnier. they own 29% of united through their cubic expression investment vehicle. mr glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. but it is not yet known whether mr mcmanus and mr magnier would support a glazer bid. nm rothschild  the investment bank  is advising mr glazer  according to the financial times. his previous adviser  jpmorgan  quit last year when mr glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three united directors to the board  against its advice. but the ft said it thought jp morgan may still have had some role in financing mr glazer s latest financial proposal.
japan economy slides to recession the japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.  gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. the fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending  and follows similar falls in gdp in the two previous quarters. the tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced  but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. on wednesday  the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which  when taking into account performance in the most recent period  effectively tips japan into recession.  a previous estimate of 0.1% growth between july and september was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. a recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth  although the japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.  figures released by the government s cabinet office showed that gdp  on an annualised basis  fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. however  politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year.  the economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture  it is in a recovery stage   said economic and fiscal policy minister heizo takenaka. gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country.  the economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at gdp alone   mr takenaka stressed.  ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that japan s largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. japan s economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. however  the economy s fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending  a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies.  the results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn t be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy   said naoki iizuka  senior economist at the dai-ichi life research institute. japan s economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.
jones medals  must go if guilty  world anti-doping agency (wada) chief dick pound says marion jones should be stripped of all her medals if found guilty of taking banned substances.  victor conte  of balco laboratories  claims the american sprinter regularly used drugs to enhance her performance.  if she is found guilty she should be stripped of all her medals and banned for two years   said pound. asked if there was a timescale as to what medals could be taken  pound said:  that is not an issue at all.  however  under international olympic committee (ioc) rules  athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event. jones  who won five medals at the 2000 olympics  denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over conte s allegations. balco laboratories is the firm at the centre of a wide-reaching investigation into doping in the us. pound continued:  if she has indeed taken drugs it is going to be a big disappointment for a lot of people.
singapore growth at 8.1% in 2004 singapore s economy grew by 8.1% in 2004  its best performance since 2000  figures from the trade ministry show.  the advance  the second-fastest in asia after china  was led by growth of 13.1% in the key manufacturing sector. however  a slower-than-expected fourth quarter points to more modest growth for the trade-driven economy in 2005 as global technology demand falls back. slowdowns in the us and china could hit electronics exports  while the tsunami disaster may effect the service sector.  economic growth is set to halve in singapore this year to between 3% and 5%. in the fourth quarter  the city state s gross domestic product (gdp) rose at an annual rate of 2.4%. that was up from the third quarter  when it fell 3.0%  but was well below analyst forecasts.  i am surprised at the weak fourth quarter number. the main drag came from electronics   said lian chia liang  economist at jp morgan chase. singapore s economy had contracted over the summer  weighed down by soaring oil prices. the economy s poor performance in the july to september period followed four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth as singapore bounced back strongly from the effects of the deadly sars virus in 2003.
blair  damaged  by blunkett row a majority of voters (68%) believe the prime minister has been damaged by the row over david blunkett s involvement in a visa application  a poll suggests.  but nearly half those surveyed said mr blunkett should return to cabinet if labour won the next election. some 63% of respondents in the sunday times poll thought his former lover - kimberly quinn - acted vindictively and 61% that he had been right to resign. yougov polled a weighted sample of 1 981 voters online on 16-18 december. mr blunkett resigned as home secretary on wednesday after an inquiry uncovered an e-mail showing a visa application by mrs quinn s former nanny had been speeded up. sir alan budd s inquiry also found mr blunkett s account of events had been wrong. almost a quarter (21%) of those polled for the sunday times said he should return to the cabinet straight after the election. one in four said he should be back in the government s top ranks within a year or two while 39% opposed a comeback.  three-quarters said mr blunkett was right to go to court for the right to see mrs quinn s son - whom he says he fathered - and just 14% voiced sympathy for mrs quinn. a total of 53% of those polled said they had sympathy for mr blunkett  with 40% saying they did not. forty-three per cent thought mr blunkett had done a good job as home secretary and 17% disagreed. meantime  32% said mr blair was a good prime minister and 38% disagreed. a majority  52%  said chancellor gordon brown had done a good job and just 16% disagreed.  a second poll for the independent on sunday found that support for all political parties remained largely unchanged after the blunkett controversy. labour lead the conservatives by 39% to 34% with the liberal democrats on 19%. communicateresearch interviewed 401 people before david blunkett s resignation and 601 afterwards. some 82% said mr blunkett had set a good example by wanting to take responsibility for the child he says is his  but 42% backed his legal action compared to 45% who thought it was unbecoming. thirty per cent said the affair showed mr blunkett could not be trusted as a minister while 63%  disagreed.
mps quiz aides over royal income senior officials at the two bodies generating private income for the queen and prince of wales are to be questioned by mps.  aides from the duchy of lancaster and duchy of cornwall will appear before the commons public accounts committee. it has been reported they could be questioned about prince charles  spending on camilla parker bowles. but bbc correspondent peter hunt said they are not responsible for how money is spent and may be unable to answer. duchy officials  who will appear before the committee on monday  are only responsible for generating money. the duchy of lancaster provides the queen s private income  while the duchy of cornwall provides prince charles  annual income. the duchy of cornwall is a 140 000-acre estate across 25 counties  and also includes residential properties  shops  offices  stocks and shares. it was set up in 1337 by king edward iii to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. it covers the cost of the prince s public and private life - neither charles  nor william and harry  receive taxpayers  money from the civil list. however  the prince of wales did receive over £4m from government departments and grants-in-aid in 2003-4. the duchy last year generated almost £12m. the prince has voluntarily paid income tax - currently 40% - since 1993.
kennedy to make temple address charles kennedy is set to address 2 000 people at a hindu temple as part of an appeal to ethnic minority voters.  the liberal democrat leader will visit the shri swaminarayan mandir temple in neasden  north west london. he will say labour  can no longer lay exclusive claim to the votes of britain s ethnic minorities . mr kennedy will also highlight the anger among people of  all races  over the iraq war and call for a  balanced approach  to tackling terrorism. saturday s speech comes days after the lib dems launched their ethnic minority mini-manifesto. mr kennedy is to tell the audience:  many people in britain  of all races  cultures and religions  were angry about the way we were taken to war in iraq.  and they saw the principled stand the liberal democrats took at the time.   he will also say that the lib dems want to  restore britain s reputation on the world stage  by fighting international poverty and climate change  and protecting human rights. mr kennedy will say that a  balanced approach  to tackling terrorism would mean  tough measures to make britain safe - but not at the expense of people s fundamental legal rights like has happened at belmarsh . he will say it also means acting through the united nations on terrorism. mr kennedy held talks with tony blair on friday over government plans to hold terror suspects under house arrest. he said afterwards that the prime minister had offered some  movement  to address his concerns. the plans face trouble in the lords if conservative and lib dem opposition continues.
hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break - but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite s bid for champions league glory.  hodgson - now in charge at viking stavanger - was at liverpool s clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefa s technical committee. hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe  although not in england - where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list. but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea  he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last 16 of the champions league.  i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge.  i am a fervent supporter of the break. it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season  which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league.  the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage.  the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today  the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed  rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february.  hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages  explaining:  as i said  it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.   and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction.  in pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players  having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot  find themselves getting very jaded.  the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and  perhaps more importantly  recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead.  the mental side is by far the most important thing.  hodgson added:  the length of breaks can vary. in italy the break was very short. you just took christmas and new year.  it was so short you didn t do anything. you gave the players a week or 10 days off  then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game.  if it is longer  it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them.  and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership. he said:  if we talk about football at elite level  which the premiership is  then i would support a winter break.  if you examine the demands of the premier league and  in particular on players who play international football for their club and country  then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally.

consumer concern over rfid tags consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency id (rfid) tags in shops  a survey says.  more than half of 2 000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags  which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low. the survey of consumers in the uk  france  germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini. the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology. the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.  more than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. ard jan vetham  capgemini s principal consultant on rfid  said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology.  acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns.  with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers  the industry can reach this point.  he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. they are also in use as a passcard for the m6 toll in the midlands  in the uk. mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance. he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. at least once consumer group - consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering (caspian) - has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. all kinds of personal belongings  including clothes  could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners  it warned.

davies favours gloucester future wales hooker mefin davies is likely to stay with english side gloucester despite reported interest from the neath-swansea ospreys.  bbc wales understands the ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old  but that he would prefer to stay where he is. davies  one of the stars of saturday s rbs six nations win over england  is only on a year contract at kingsholm. but the hooker has proved his worth to the zurich premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season. the summer demise of the celtic warriors region left davies in the cold and forced him to take a semi-professional contract with neath rfc. although he got match time with the ospreys at the request of the wales management  he admitted before his move to gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated.  the wru didn t give me any help off the field  it was very disappointing   davies said at the time.  it was a hard time throughout the summer  then deciding whether to accept an offer from stade francais which would have ended my wales career.

premier league planning cole date the premier league is attempting to find a mutually convenient date to investigate allegations chelsea made an illegal approach for ashley cole.  both chelsea and arsenal will be asked to give evidence to a premier league commission  but no deadline has been put on when that meeting will convene.  it s hard to put a date on it   a premier league spokesman confirmed to bbc sport.  it s not a formal situation where they ve got so much time to respond.  arsenal and england defender cole reportedly met blues boss jose mourinho and chief executive peter kenyon in a london hotel 11 days ago. chelsea have yet to officially confirm or deny the meeting  which would be in breach of premier league rule k3.  now the gunners have asked for an inquiry to look into claims that their player has been  tapped up . both clubs have pledged to co-operate with the inquiry which will be conducted on a single day as opposed to being run as an ongoing evaluation. cole is in negotiations with the gunners over extending his current deal which ends in 2007. and his arsenal team-mate robert pires has urged the england left-back to stay at highbury. pires told the evening standard:  he has been at arsenal for ever. he is a very attacking left-back and i think he is enjoying his football because at arsenal he plays in an offensive team.  i am not sure he will get the same pleasure at chelsea  even though they are doing so well at the moment.  i have built a fantastic playing relationship with ashley.  we play together so well - we could do it with our eyes shut.  but you have to respect the decision of the player. everybody has that right.
china continues rapid growth china s economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004  faster than predicted and well above 2003 s 9.1%.  the news may mean more limits on investment and lending as beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. china has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion  which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. but officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed  with services providing much of the impetus. growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004  down from 17% the previous year.  still  consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004  adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. and overall investment in fixed assets was still high  up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. the result could be higher interest rates. china raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in october 2004.  despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong  economists said.  there is no sign of a slowdown in 2005   said tim congdon  economist at ing barings.  china s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand  but also from soaring sales overseas. figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004  up 35%. part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan  china s currency. the government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the us dollar  - much to the chagrin of many us lawmakers who blame china for lost jobs and competitiveness. despite urging to ease the peg  officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate.  we need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time   national bureau of statistics chief li deshui told reuters.  those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.
howard  truanted to play snooker  conservative leader michael howard has admitted he used to play truant to spend time with his school friends at a snooker hall.  mr howard said his time at jack s snooker hall in llanelli in the 1950s had not done him  any lasting damage . but he told the times educational supplement that truancy was  very bad  and said  firm action  was needed. mr howard also called for a return to o-levels and more classroom discipline.  mr howard eventually left llanelli grammar school - and the snooker hall - to go to cambridge university. he said:  i don t think it s done me any lasting damage. nor has it made me a snooker world champion.  there might have been some occasions when we left early of an afternoon.   i m just being honest. i think truancy is a very bad thing and that firm action should be taken to deal with it.  another player who has failed to win snooker s world championship - jimmy  the whirlwind   white - has previously admitted missing lessons  instead spending his days in smoky halls.  tony meo [another player] and me used to spend all of our spare time there   mr white said   we loved the game and the atmosphere.  school went out of the window. i went for a while and then started taking time off.  mr howard s fellow welshman ray reardon - known by his fellow professionals as  dracula  - won the snooker world championship six times  having left school at 14 to work as a miner. and terry griffiths  like mr howard from llanelli  won the tournament in 1979. it is not known whether the two of them ever clashed cues at jack s.
roche  turns down federer offer  australian tennis coach tony roche has turned down an approach from roger federer to be the world number one s new full-time coach  say reports.  melbourne s herald-sun said roche  troubled by a hip complaint  did not want to travel full-time again. however  roche is happy to work with the swiss star on a casual basis and is helping him prepare for next month s defence of his australian open crown. federer has been without a coach since splitting with peter lundgren in 2003. roche  a former davis cup player for australia  won the french open  reached the wimbledon and us open finals and won five wimbledon doubles titles with john newcombe.  he also coached former number one ivan lendl and pat rafter to grand slam victories and has worked with australia s lleyton hewitt. some reports claim federer initially wanted andre agassi s australian coach darren cahill  before agassi confirmed he would play on in 2005. federer was named swiss sportsman of the year on saturday  to add to the bbc overseas sportsman and european sports journalists association awards he has already won.
bets off after big brother  leak  a bookmaker has stopped taking bets on celebrity big brother after claiming  sensitive information  about the channel 4 show had been leaked.  william hill made the move after four people tried to place bets on friday s surprise double eviction.  this is highly unlikely to have been an inspired guess   william hill spokesman rupert adams said. however  a big brother spokeswoman was  satisfied  that sensitive information about the show remained confidential.  the bookmaker said its suspicions had been aroused by betting for the last two contestant evictions  when people were still trying to place large sums despite odds as short as 1/14. but william hill s  overwhelming evidence  came on friday when four unknown callers asked to place bets on the show s surprise double eviction.  shortly afterwards model caprice and actor jeremy edwards left the show. mr adams believed someone had gained access to figures which revealed how viewers were voting  and was using them to predict which celebrity would be evicted next.  we think somebody somewhere has got them and has been trying very hard to take us to the cleaners   he said. the bets were not taken. mr adams did not believe anyone from channel 4 or big brother producer endemol had tried to place the queried bets. but he added:  they need to look at how many people are privy to the sensitive information.   big brother s spokeswoman said:  only a handful of senior production executives are privy to any sensitive information regarding eviction voting and there are strict procedures in place to keep this information strictly confidential.  we do not feel the need to investigate this further as we are satisfied that these measures are effective.  the show s independent adjudicator - the electoral reform services - was also satisfied  she added. the current series of celebrity big brother ends on sunday  with happy mondays star bez  actress brigitte nielsen and blazin  squad rapper kenzie competing for a £50 000 charity prize.  bookmaker ladbrokes said it would continue to accept bets on the final  with kenzie its favourite at 2/9.  we felt no need whatsoever to close the book   spokesman warren lush said.  we ve seen absolutely no suspicious betting patterns.  mr lush added that people sometimes vote on short odds  because they think it s like buying money .  you do have to risk quite a lot of money for a very small gain but if they think there s no chance of an upset they will still do it   he said.
gadget market  to grow in 2005  the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005  delegates at the world s largest gadget show  in las vegas  have been told.  the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11%  while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important.  everything is going digital   kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association  told the bbc news website. the consumer electronics show (ces) featured the pick of 2005 s products.  consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs [high-definition tvs]  digital radio  and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005.  all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry.  despite showing diversity  some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much  wow factor  as in previous years.  the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces  which was the  time and place shifting  of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere  at any time. at the start of last year s ces  the cea predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004. that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players  personal video recorders and digital cameras. it was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice  with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. part of this has been the rise in spending power of the  generation x-ers  who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. more than 57% of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers  according to cea research. hybrid devices  which combine a number of multimedia functions  were also in evidence on the show floor.  a lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it   said stephen baker  a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group.  some of these functions cost next to nothing to add.   as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable mp3 players to giant high-definition tvs  several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders  such as microsoft chief bill gates. despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate s pre-show speech  he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the us market. he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. he disappointed some  however  by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console. another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony s new portable games device  the psp  had at the show. sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe. it went on sale in japan before christmas. there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their  consumer technology  offering.  elsewhere at the show  there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens  including samsung s 102-inch (2.6 metre) plasma - the largest in the world. industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005  with new formats for dvds coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional dvds. with so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage  like seagate s 5gb pocket sized external hard drive  which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. more than 120 000 trade professionals attended ces in las vegas  which officially ran from 6 to 9 january.
gebrselassie in london triple bid double olympic 10 000m champion haile gebrselassie will race in the london marathon for the next three years.  the ethiopian legend won sunday s almeria half-marathon in spain on his return from an operation on his achilles tendon. he was third in london in 2002 in his first serious attempt at the marathon.  it is a coup for us to secure haile s presence for the next three years and it guarantees a quality race   said race director david bedford. gebrselassie will face olympic champion stefano baldini  world champion jaouad gharib  and arch-rival paul tergat  the current world record holder.  if i didn t think i could win i would not be here   said gebrselassie  who has set world records on 18 occasions in his illustrious career and is keen to add the marathon record to his collection.  there are a lot of fantastic runners in the race but i shall be doing my utmost to upset them.
bath faced with tindall ultimatum mike tindall s agent has warned bath they have until next week to improve their contract offer to the england man or risk losing him to a rival club.  dipo alli says he has received an offer for tindall which dwarfs bath s deal and that two other clubs want to talk.  mike does not want to go into the six nations worrying about where he will be playing his club rugby next season   alli told the guardian newspaper.  it is up to (bath owner) andrew brownsword. he has to make it happen.  tindall is out of contract at the end of the season but it is understood that brownsword is unwilling to break the club s salary structure to accommodate the 26-year-old s demands. but alli insists the player is worth more than bath have put on the table.  mike has been at bath for eight years and wants to remain with the club and his demands are anything but excessive   the agent added.  but brownsword has to recognise mike s value and we want to resolve things by the end of next week.
rush future at chester uncertain ian rush s future as chester manager is uncertain after he and assistant mark aizlewood refused a severance package.  chester have won only two of their last 10 league games but chairman steve vaughan claims he cannot afford to sack the 43-year-old liverpool legend. vaughan said:  i offered a financial settlement so they could resign with dignity but an obvious action is to dismiss them.  i haven t because of the finances  so technically they re still employees.  vaughan claimed that aizlewood had  verbally agreed  to the offer. but the chester chairman added:  after they discussed the offer with their solicitor  who also acts as their agent  they decided to withdraw the verbal agreement  which was disappointing.  rush was appointed at the end of august following the departure of former liverpool team-mate mark wright  who guided chester to the conference title last season. chester were bottom of league two when rush took over but the former liverpool striker enjoyed an impressive start to managerial life  taking the club into the third round of the fa cup and winning the manager-of-the-month award for october. chester s downturn in form culminated in a 5-0 defeat at shrewsbury that leaves them hovering just above the league two relegation zone.
keegan hails comeback king fowler manchester city boss kevin keegan has praised striker robbie fowler for his landmark return to form.  the 29-year-old  out of favour at city earlier this season  took his premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in monday s 3-2 win at norwich.  he is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and  in the end  we did   keegan said.  he has worked hard to get back to where he is now.  the former liverpool striker  who moved to city in 2003 after a poor stint at leeds  has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.  fowler overtook les ferdinand on tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the premiership  with 151 goals  and he only trails alan shearer (250) and andy cole (173). and keegan believes there is still more to come from the former england forward.  he can get better if we can supply him better   added keegan.  people want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.  fowler s double strike helped city come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at carrow road and keegan sympathised with norwich boss nigel worthington afterwards.  i feel a bit for nigel worthington   he said.  his team have got great character  they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm.  i know it is a killer blow for norwich but i really think they have brought something to the premiership.  the stadium and the atmosphere is great  it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.

england coach faces rap after row england coach andy robinson is facing disciplinary action after criticising referee jonathan kaplan in his side s six nations defeat to ireland.  the rugby football union (rfu) will investigate robinson after deciding not to lodge a complaint against kaplan. robinson may even have to apologise for his comments in order to avoid sanction from the international rugby board. robinson had said he was  livid  about kaplan s decisions on saturday to disallow two england  tries.  the england coach went on to claim that  only one side was refereed .  after reviewing tapes of the match  the rfu decided not to formally complain to the irb over the standard of kaplan s refereeing. instead the rfu said in a statement they would   set out any concerns the england team management may have in a confidential manner .  an irb spokesman said on the matter:  we take all breaches of the code very seriously.  should the rfu resolve the issue to our satisfaction  as happened last month when the scotland coach matt williams apologised for remarks made  it would be the end of the matter.   kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in england s 19-13 defeat at landsdowne road and admitted he was  very disappointed  with robinson s remarks. and the south african has been appointed to take charge of scotland s match against wales on 13 march.  the rfu recently fined northampton coach budge pountney £2 000 and imposed a six-week ban for his criticism of referee steve lander after a premiership match.
lib dems target the student vote students can decide the fate of mps in some seats at the next election  liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has claimed.  the party says the votes of students can win it 27 new seats at the poll. the figures assume all students will vote in their university town. in fact  some may vote where the parents live. the lib dems say scrapping university fees wins them student support. but the tories would also end fees and labour says both would cap people s ambitions.  the lib dems have named the 14 seats where there are enough students to take the lib dems from second place to beat labour  and the 13 where they could go from second to beat the tories. launching his campaign to win students  votes at the london school of economics  mr kennedy urged students to  make their mark . he underlined lib dem plans to scrap university fees and reintroduce maintenance grants of up to £2 000. he said:  top-up fees put students off university  especially those from a poorer background.  and is it really right that so many young people are starting out in life with mortgage-style debts hanging round their necks   mr kennedy also said students want action on the environment and see the iraq war  which his party opposed  as a defining issue.  labour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to £3 000 a year  with the poorest students eligible for non-repayable support of up to £3 000. ahead of mr kennedy s launch  a labour spokesperson said:  like the tories  the liberal democrats would restrict access to higher education and put a cap on aspiration  closing the door to students with good grades and restricting their life ambitions.  they are committed to abandoning labour s targets of getting 50% of 18 to 30-year-olds going into higher education and under lib dem plans students would even have to study near home.  the conservatives say they would abolish university tuition fees and instead offer large student loans at commercial rates of interest.  they say the lib dem policy would leave universities wholly dependent for their income on the  goodwill  of the chancellor.  shadow education secretary tim collins is on thursday setting out a new scheme of vocational grants for 14 to 16-year-olds to tackle what he says are  crippling skills shortages . the lib dem analysis of the difference students could make to its election chances is based on all students being registered to vote near their university  not in their home towns. although the expected 5 may election would be during term time  students can vote by post. the electoral commission and national union of students are worried students in halls of residence can find it hard to register to vote. some hall wardens are reluctant to register students because of data protection fears - but students can get themselves registered. if the election is on 5 may  voters need to register by 11 march.    - the seats where the lib dems say student votes can swing the election for them are: bristol west  cardiff central  leeds north west  cambridge  manchester gorton  sheffield central  oxford east  newcastle-upon-tyne central  liverpool riverside  holborn and st pancras  oldham east and saddleworth  manchester withington  islington south and finsbury  birmingham yardley  surrey south west  taunton  orpington  haltemprice and howden  eastbourne  isle of wight  dorset west  bournemouth east  wells  canterbury  cities of london and westminster  bournemouth west  westmorland and lonsdale.
china s shanda buys stake in sina chinese online game operator shanda interactive entertainment has bought a 20% stake in sina  the country s biggest internet portal firm.  the move may be a precursor to a full takeover  with analysts saying that a better-known international firm may also now show an interest in sina. shanda said that it may boost its stake in sina  even buying it outright. a merger would create a firm that offers online role-playing games  news  entertainment and wireless messaging.  sina said that the purchase of a stake by shanda would have no impact on its business.  the board of directors said in a statement that it would  continue to act in the best interests of all the company stakeholders  including shareholders  employees and customers . both companies are listed on the new york stock exchange s (nyse) technology-dominated nasdaq index. in a filing with the us securities and exchange commission  sina said its shares were purchased between 12 january and 10 february for about $230m. rumours about a possible takeover boosted sina s shares by more than 10% on friday. they added an extra 6.4% to $27.24 in electronic trading after the trading session had finished. and there may be more gains amid bid speculation when trading resumes in new york on tuesday after monday s public holiday  analysts forecast.  there could still be some potential parties that could still counter bid   said wallace cheung  an analyst at dbs vickers.  even though shanda has 20% of sina  they still have quite a long way to take full control.  however  mr cheung noted that a foreign company trying to take control of a chinese internet portal firm  with its ability to filter and pass on news  may not be viewed very favourably by beijing.
tories  would cut number of mps  the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one-fifth if they were elected  tory leader michael howard has said.  the plan forms part of the party s  smaller government bill   to be unveiled later this week. mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. and he said a referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly.  the changes would all take place within five years of the conservatives winning a general election  mr howard told the paper.  the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum  but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps. mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall - labour by more than 80 000 and the tories by almost 100 000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers.  it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced  but what about ministers  parliament and special advisers   he said. shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said:  this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people s lives by reducing the size and role of the state .  mr howard said the plan would also even out the  great unfairness  of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england. the average size of an english constituency was 70 000 people  mr howard said. in northern ireland it was just over 66 000  in wales just over 59 000 and in scotland 53 000. the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was  consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom  if the assembly was scrapped. mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next.  you have got to have a big bang. we don t want this like the house of lords reform  getting to one stage and then not having the next stage.
labour faces  cold calls  inquiry labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on  cold calling  householders.  the information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the lib dems about how labour uses its call centres. the lib dems say labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls. labour denies breaking rules. it says calls are not marketing if they just ask about people s voting intentions. the party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue.  telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service (tps) lists  which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. lib dem chairman matthew taylor has written to the watchdog accusing labour of a  flagrant and systematic breach  of the laws governing the tps.  he says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future. his letter to the commissioner quotes from a labour party handbook about  identifying target voters . and it quotes a stevenage labour party members  newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions.  the voters are put in 24 categories according to their last known voting intention  ranging from  labour (firm)  to  target (conservative)  - those who supported the party in the past but this time will be voting tory. the newsletter says:  using the information we know about people  we can send them direct mailings.  for example  we could send the target (conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the tories to labour explaining the reasons why voting tory is a bad idea or we could send labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote.   mr taylor tells the commissioner:  it is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the labour party is engaging in a large-scale voter id project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings.  insofar as this project is directed at tps subscribers  it is equally clear that it is unlawful.  the lib dems raised worries about labour and conservative calls in february and 680 people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain. a party official said there was only scattered evidence of the tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about labour.  a spokeswoman for the information commissioner s office said it was examining one complaint about political calls - understood to be mr taylor s.  we are investigating one of the complaints where some evidence has been given to us   she said.  obviously evidence is needed for us to start investigations.  the commissioner s office will now examine the lib dem evidence.  the guidance is that cold calling can be made as long as no marketing is going on   said the spokeswoman. if labour is judged to have broken the rules  it will be asked stop immediately. if it fails to do so after two or three warning letters  the commissioner can issue an enforcement notice spelling out what the party needs to do or stop doing.  the party could appeal against the decision to an information tribunal. if the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules  it could be fined up to £5 000. labour says it avoids those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making  voter identification  calls. asked about the commissioner s inquiry  a labour spokesman told bbc news:  we expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously. however  we are absolutely clear that we haven t broken any rules.  as the information commissioner himself has said  if people are not marketing something  if they are asking them which way they are going to vote  they are not in breach of the law.  we always ask everyone we phone up whether they would be happy to be contacted by the labour party again.
super size me wins writers  award super size me director morgan spurlock has won the writers guild of america s award for documentary feature writing.  the oscar-nominated film followed spurlock as he ate only mcdonald s fast food for an entire month. spurlock was given the award at a special ceremony at the roosevelt hotel in hollywood on tuesday. organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time.  producer brian grazer presented the award to spurlock and the film s backers  roadside attractions  samuel goldwyn films and showtime independent films. spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but mcdonald s for a month  upgrading to supersize portions when offered. the film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body  including his liver and cholesterol levels. mcdonald s announced it was to scrap its  supersized  meals last year  but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by spurlock s film. spurlock was given his award on the same day the european court of human rights ruled that two uk activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a mcdonald s libel action. helen steel and david morris  from north london  dubbed the  mclibel two   were found guilty in a 1990s trial of libelling the company in a leaflet they had been handing out at the end of the case the high court in london ruled mcdonald s had been libelled and awarded the company £60 000 in damages  later reduced to £40 000 on appeal. but he found the leaflet was true in some aspects.
how the academy awards flourished the 77th annual academy awards are taking place on 27 february with the stars of the movie-making world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year. but from humble beginnings  how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today   how it all started the first academy awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.  just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at $5.  the first film to win was wings  which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. for the first 10 years or so  the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm  but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced  leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner.  the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous grauman s chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event. other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium. they are now held at the kodak theatre  which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6 000 people. until 1954 they were held on a thursday  then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on  although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february. the first televised ceremony was in 1953  with bob hope as the mc. who was oscar  there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar.  one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar. a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article.  the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn s first best actress win in 1934. the academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons. since its inception 2 530 oscars have been handed out. in support of the war effort  the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii. after the war  winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000  52 were recovered nine days later. winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. who sits in judgement  the academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. there are now 5 700 members of the academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy  receipt of an academy award nomination  achievement of unique distinction  earning of special merit  or making an outstanding contribution to film. the stars who left empty-handed while many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the academy  there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics.  among the overlooked films were hobson s choice  dirty harry  the 39 steps  the searchers and king kong. actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer (1927)  humphrey bogart in casablanca (1944)  gene kelly in singing in the rain (1952) and henry fonda in 12 angry men (1957). alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event. there were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in iraq  but as it didn t stop during world war ii or the vietnam war.  documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion. the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. los angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan. controversies and other gaffes three people have refused oscars  including actor george c scott who said the whole thing was  demeaning . writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in 1935 for his screenplay for the insider because the writers  guild was striking at the time. marlon brando turned down his best actor oscar for the godfather in 1973 in protest as hollywood s apparent discrimination against native american people. he sent along a woman called sacheen littlefeather to collect his award. she was later revealed to be native american actress maria cruz.  the following year robert opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked  flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. the tv network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. opal was murdered in 1979. frank capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared  come on up and get it  frank  to which frank capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant frank lloyd had won for cavalcade.  capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for it happened one night.
double injury blow strikes wales wales centre sonny parker and number eight ryan jones will miss saturday s game with italy because of injury.  parker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over england  and tom shanklin is expected to continue at centre. jones damaged his collar bone after coming on as a replacement against england and joins flanker colin charvis (foot injury) on the sidelines. meanwhile  mike ruddock may make gavin henson his first-choice kicker in rome. the centre was wales  hero in the 11-9 six nations win over england  landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game. first-choice kicker stephen jones handed over responsibility because of henson s greater kicking range  but the fly-half had already missed a number of shots at goal.  our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team  but giving him the kicks is something we ll talk about in selection this week   wales coach mike ruddock told bbc sport wales. henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last saturday s game.  i thrive on it and think it makes me perform better   he said.  i m glad it s a short week before the italy game. there was so much build-up before england  but we fly out to rome on thursday and we ll be back playing again.
blair told to double overseas aid tony blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries  debt and double aid.  some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels  oxfam says in a report  paying the price. the call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the g8 of top industrialised nations.  as rich countries get richer  they re giving less and less. this scandal must stop   oxfam s barbara stocking said.   the world s poorest children are paying for rich countries  policies in aid and debt with their lives.  2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough  but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure   the charity s director added. the report said:  for rich countries  providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice  not an act of charity.  it also points out that in 1970 the g8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid. but 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable  the report says.  it argues that the price of not investing in poor countries  sustainable development will be felt across the world. the report said:  global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security.  environmental crises and natural disasters  disease and drug trafficking know no national borders. poverty heightens the likelihood of conflict and unrest.  new threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities.  criminal and terrorist networks are more likely to operate where state institutions are weak.   both the prime minister and chancellor gordon brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty. mr blair  who has described africa as a  scar  on the world s conscience  has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. mr brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to britain by the world s poor nations. a spokeswoman for the department for international development said:  the government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013.  if britain s proposal for an international finance facility were adopted  the objective of 0.7% could be achieved earlier  by 2008-09.  these additional resources will be used to increase uk bilateral aid to africa to at least £1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least £1.5bn on hiv/aids related work over the next three years.
dollar hovers around record lows the us dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on friday as concern grows about the size of the us budget deficit.  analysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the us economy. the bush administration s apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. however  trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. this has amplified reactions to news  analysts said  adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in january.  the dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on thursday. one dollar bought 102.55 yen.  disappointing business figures from chicago triggered the us currency s weakness on thursday. the national association of purchasing management-chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2  a bigger fall than expected.  there are no dollar buyers now  especially after the chicago data yesterday   said abn amro s paul mackel. at the same time  german chancellor gerhard schroeder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. mr berlusconi said the euro s strength was  absolutely worrying  for italian exports. mr schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. investors will now look towards february s meeting of finance ministers from the g7 industrialised nations in london for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar s decline.
ink helps drive democracy in asia the kyrgyz republic  a small  mountainous state of the former soviet republic  is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country s elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.  this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population. in an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as  an island of democracy   the kyrgyz president  askar akaev  pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision.  the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003  reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies. the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the german embassy  the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.  the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated. the ink is sprayed on a person s left thumb. it dries and is not visible under normal light.  however  the presence of ultraviolet light (of the kind used to verify money) causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light. at the entrance to each polling station  one election official will scan voter s fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter  and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. likewise  any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot. these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors - the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics  notably ukraine and georgia. the use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government.  widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep - a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society.  the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful  radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems. others  such as the aggressively middle of the road  coalition of non-governmental organizations  have lauded the move as an important step forward. this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world  in countries as varied as serbia  south africa  indonesia and turkey. the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in afghanistan showed  improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems. the use of  invisible  ink is not without its own problems. in most elections  numerous rumors have spread about it.  in serbia  for example  both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion. other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink - various soft drinks  solvents and cleaning products are put forward. however  in reality  the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off. the ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week. the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills. the passage of the inking law is  nevertheless  a clear step forward towards free and fair elections.  the country s widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 february.  david mikosz works for the ifes  an international  non-profit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies.
first look at playstation 3 chip some details of the chip inside sony s playstation 3 have been revealed.  sony  ibm and toshiba have released limited data about the so-called cell chip that will be able to carry out trillions of calculations per second. the chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. the playstation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch.  the three firms have been working on the chip since 2001 but before now few details have been released about how it might function. in a joint statement the three firms gave hints about how the chip will work but fuller details will be released in february next year at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco.  the three firms claim that the cell chip will be up to 10 times more powerful than existing processors. when put inside powerful computer servers  the cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations  or calculations  every second. the chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. ibm said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the us. the first machines off the line using the cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. a working version of the ps3 is due to be shown off in may 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. as well as being inside the playstation 3  the chip will also be used inside high-definition tvs and powerful computers.  in the future  all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network   said ken kutaragi  chief operating officer of sony.  current pc architecture is nearing its limits.
sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.  sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour s worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. so-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.  the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed  said sun s chief operating officer jonathan schwartz.  why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour   he asked in a webcast launching sun s quarterly network computing event in california. the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil  gas and financial services industries.  some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5 000 processors each  sun said. mr schwartz ran a demonstration of the service  showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. hundreds of servers were used simultaneously  working on the problem for a few seconds each.  although it only took a few seconds  the experiment cost $12 (£6.30) because it had used up 12 hour s worth of computing power. the sun grid relies on solaris  the operating system owned by sun. initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm  which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by sun.

original exorcist to be screened the original version of horror prequel exorcist: the beginning  dropped by producers over claims it was not scary enough  is to have its world premiere.  the film  directed by paul schrader  will be screened on 18 march at the international festival of fantastic film in brussels. the psychological drama stars stellan skarsgard and foreruns the 1973 film. schrader was replaced by director renny harlin who made a new version of the film which debuted in 2004. the prequel project was originally announced in 2001  with actor liam neeson in the lead role and john frankenheimer as director. however frankenheimer pulled out in 2002  a month before he died.  skarsgard then replaced neeson in the role of father merrin  made famous by max von sydow in the 1973 film. principal footage was shot in morocco and rome at a reported cost of $32m. however  in august 2003 it emerged that producers morgan creek were shelving schrader s version of the film  having complained it was not scary enough. as well as replacing schrader with harlin - the director behind die hard 2 and cliffhanger - the producers also changed most of the cast  but swedish star skarsgard stayed in the merrin role. harlin s film  released in the uk in october 2004  received lukewarm reviews but went on to make over $76m (£40.7m) worldwide. the festival screening will be the first time that schrader s film has been seen in public. reports that it will be released either in cinemas or on dvd have yet to be confirmed. other films at the festival in the belgium capital  which runs from 11-26 march  include the us horror hit boogeyman and the forthcoming sequel ring 2  as well as a selection of films adapted from the works of jules verne.
uefa approves fake grass uefa says it will allow european matches to be played on artificial pitches from the start of next season.  european football s governing body made the decision at a meeting of its executive committee on wednesday. uefa explained that the move  follows comprehensive studies into the sporting and medical aspects of using artificial playing surfaces.  they can be used subject to complying with uefa quality criteria but there use will not be made obligatory. luton  preston  queens park rangers and other clubs used to have plastic pitches during the the 1980s but  after a two-year study  uefa insists the surfaces have moved on. international matches can also be played on such pitches  although games at major tournaments have to be contested on grass. uefa spokesman rob faulkner said:  people in england have bad memories of the artificial pitches of luton and qpr in the 1980s  but the latest generation are completely different and are much more like grass.  we have sanctioned its use from the start of next season but only as long as it is the latest generation of artificial turf and meets a whole series of standards.  several leading clubs from scandinavia  russia and eastern europe - especially those who only play champions league or uefa cup matches in winter - are now expected to instal artificial pitches.
connors boost for british tennis former world number one jimmy connors is planning a long-term relationship with the lawn tennis association to help unearth the next tim henman.  the american spent three days at the lta s annual elite performance winter camp in la manga earlier this week.  britain has the right attitude   said connors.  the more involved i can be with the lta  the better.  a short-term arrangement is just confusing. the kids will ask:  what am i doing there    lta chief executive  john crowther  added:  the relationship that jimmy s already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we d like some more of it.  we want to use jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship.   the camp played host to more than 30 leading senior and junior players  including greg rusedski  arvind parmar and anne keothavong.  la manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best   said connors  speaking at queen s club in london.  what impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had.  it was interesting to me to see kids of 15  16  17  with that desire and passion  and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them.  instilling the importance of work and practice is something you can t buy.  they know what s been given to them and all they have to do is give back the effort  and every minute of practice they were doing that.   speaking from la manga  lta performance director david felgate told bbc sport:  jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches  and very humble considering what he s achieved.  he worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and he ll get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them.  he made it clear from the word go he didn t want it to be short-term. this is a 52-week-a-year job for me  it s my life and my passion and it s the same with the coaches.  he respects that but he wants to be involved and have real input. and why would he stake his reputation on something that s not going to be successful   connors has also agreed to commentate for the bbc at next year s wimbledon championships. he will work during the second week of the tournament.
lions blow to world cup stars british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year s rbs six nations championship.  world cup winners lawrence dallaglio  neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer s tour to new zealand.  i don t think you can ever say never   said woodward.  but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.  dallaglio  back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. but woodward added:  the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark.  my job  along with all the other senior representatives  is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team.  if you are not playing international rugby then it s still a step up to test rugby. it s definitely a disadvantage.   i think it s absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.  woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open.  it is an open book   he said.  there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries.  and following the all blacks  impressive displays in europe in recent weeks  including a 45-6 humiliation of france  woodward believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge.  their performance in particular against france was simply awesome   said the lions coach.  certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five  but they re a very powerful unit.  with his customary thoroughness  woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland.  as a result  woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots.  scotland s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances.  eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions.  and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call  provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems.  i took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn t fit and went on the trip.  every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip.  i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions - and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat.
blair hails turkey-eu talks deal tony blair has hailed a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership as important for the world s future  peace and prosperity .  mr blair has been a leading advocate of turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. leaving a brussels summit mr blair said  the fact turkey is a muslim country does not mean it should be barred . the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus. it was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but turkish premier recep erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full eu membership.  if it joins  turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. mr blair said having turkey in the eu was of  importance to the future peace and prosperity of my country  britain  and the wider world .   we are stating a fundamental principle that the fact turkey is a muslim country does not mean it should be barred from europe.  on the contrary  if it fulfils the same principles of human rights  then muslim and christian can work together.  under the agreement  turkey must issue a written statement promising to sign an accord effectively recognising the greek cypriot government  but gives turkey more time to sell the idea to its people.  the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member  but turkey  which occupies northern cyprus  had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country  calling the issue a  red line . it could take up to 15 years before turkey is able to join  and entry cannot be guaranteed. the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april 2005. however  talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia.
uk helps raped rwandan women britain is to give a £4m grant to help women survivors of the rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with hiv/aids.  an estimated 25 000 girls and women were raped during the 1994 genocide. about 800 000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed by hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic hutu leader. the five-year department for international development funding will enable more survivors to have access to anti-retroviral treatment.  the plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time. it was overshadowed by rwanda s emergence from the 100 days of slaughter  during which time the mass killings took place  and the women s fate was largely a taboo subject. but many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but  in many cases  orphans too.  as the women die  the number of rwanda s orphans rises. until recently  very few of the women have had access to anti-retroviral treatment. that is now starting to change. this funding is intended to make anti-retrovirals and other care available for some 2 500 women. mary kayitesi blewitt  founder of the survivors fund (surf)  one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled  said it was a recognition  before it was too late  that the survivors should be a priority for help.
s&n extends indian beer venture the uk s biggest brewer  scottish and newcastle (s&n)  is to buy 37.5% of india s united breweries in a deal worth 4.66bn rupees ($106m:£54.6m).  s&n will buy a 17.5% equity stake in united  maker of the well-known kingfisher lager brand  and make a public offer to buy another 20% stake. a similar holding will be controlled by vijay mallya  chair of the indian firm. the deal was a  natural development  of its joint venture with united  said tony froggatt  s&n s chief executive.  its top brands include newcastle brown ale  foster s  john smith s  strongbow and kronenbourg. in 2002 s&n and united agreed to form a strategic partnership  one that would include a joint venture business and a uk investment in the indian brewer. the joint venture was established in may 2003. with both parties having a 40% stake in the venture - millennium alcobev. millennium alcobev will now be merged with united  which expects post-merger to have about half of india s beer market.  india  with a population of more than one billion  consumes about 1.2 billion bottles of beer every year. kingfisher has market share of about 29%. in addition to the equity stake s&n is to invest 2.47bn rupees in united through non-convertible redeemable preference shares. meanwhile  united s budget airline  kingfisher airlines  is to buy 10 a320 aircraft from airbus and has the option to buy 20 more aircraft in a deal worth up to $1.8bn. the airline  the brainchild of mr mallya  expects to start its operations by the end of april. the new airline would break even in the very first year of operation  mr mallya said.
camera phones are  must-haves  four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year  says a report from analysts gartner.  globally  the number sold will reach 159 million  an increase of 104%. the report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly  must-have  buy. in europe  cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific  where camera phone technology is much more advanced  mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology  and the uptake there is huge. by 2008  according to gartner  95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.  camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them  as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services). this has changed in the last 18 months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways  they have introduced more design features  like rotating screens and viewfinders  removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.  mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites  or mobile blogs - moblogs. but the report suggests that until image quality increases more  people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005  it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality  and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. some handsets already feature limited zoom capability  and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions  like nightclubs. other developments include wide-angle modes  basic editing features  and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.  images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap  will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.  the exhibition  fonetography  will feature images taken by photographers david bailey  rankin and nan goldin  and artists sir peter blake  tracey emin and jack vettriano. but some uses for them have worried many organisations. intel  samsung  the uk s foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us  have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. many schools  fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. italy s information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers  profits. according to recent figures  sony ericsson s profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras  it said.

baron kinnock makes lords debut former labour leader neil kinnock has officially been made a life peer during a ceremony in the house of lords.  he will be known baron kinnock of bedwellty - after his former constituency. lord kinnock - who led labour from 1983 until 1992 - was until recently one of britain s eu commissioners. a former critic of the house of lords  he has said he will use the upper house to advocate its reform and to talk on issues like higher education.  i accepted the kind invitation to enter the house of lords as a working peer for practical political reasons   he said when his peerage was first announced.  it is a good base for campaigning on national issues like education  sustainable transport  industrial change and the ageing society and global concerns  particularly poverty and oppression.  during his induction into the upper house  lord kinnock was accompanied by lords leader baroness amos and baroness royall of blaisdon  a former aide to the ex-labour leader. it has been a long journey for the new lord kinnock from his earliest days as a rebellious youngster in the south wales valleys. born in 1942 in tredegar to a miner father and nurse mother  he attended lewis boys  school in nearby pengam  known then as the  eton of the valleys . from there he went to cardiff university  where he met his future wife glenys  now a labour mep.  after a brief career as a tutor for the workers  educational association  he became an mp at the age of just 28 for his home seat of bedwellty (later islwyn). he gained a reputation as a left-wing firebrand  voting against his own labour government s spending cuts proposals in 1975  and later rejecting a junior post in james callaghan s administration. but he joined the shadow cabinet in 1980  and after labour s heavy defeat in the 1983 he was elected leader. he took on the far-left militant tendency and began the long process of returning his party to the centre ground. he was not expected to win the 1987 election  when margaret thatcher was still riding high  but was bitterly disappointed to lose the next one in 1992 to john major  and stepped down. he remained an mp until 1995  when he resigned to become european commission for transport. four years later he became vice-president of the european commission  with responsibility for internal reform. as he assumes the title of lord kinnock  he has also become chairman of the british council  which promotes the uk s reputation for arts  science and education.
merritt close to indoor 400m mark teenager lashawn merritt ran the third fastest indoor 400m of all time at the fayetteville invitational meeting.  the world junior champion clocked 44.93 seconds to finish well clear of fellow american bershawn jackson in arkansas. only michael johnson has gone quicker  setting the world record of 44.63secs in 1995 and running 44.66secs in 1996. kenyan bernard lagat missed out on the world record by 1.45secs as he ran the third quickest indoor mile ever to beat canada s nate brannen by almost 10secs. the olympic silver medallist s time of three minutes 49.89secs was inferior only to the 1997 world record of moroccan hicham el guerrouj and former world record holder eamonn coghlan of ireland s 3:49.78. lagat was on course to break el guerrouj s record through 1200m but could not maintain the pace over the final 400m. ireland s  continued his excellent form by winning a tight 3 000m in 7:40.53. cragg  who recently defeated olympic 10 000m champion kenenisa bekele in boston  held off bekele s ethiopian colleague markos geneti by only 0.19secs to secure his victory. mark carroll  who will join cragg in the european indoor championships next month  finished a solid third in 7:46.78. olympic 200m gold medallist  of jamaica ran the fastest women s 60m in the world this year as she equalled her personal best of 7.09secs. world indoor 60m hurdles champion  also won  improving his season-leading time to 7.51secs.
england claim dubai sevens glory england beat fiji 26-21 in a dramatic final in dubai to win the first irb sevens event of the season.  having beaten australia and south africa to reach the final  england fell behind to an early try against fiji. they then took charge with scores from pat sanderson  kai horstman  mathew tait and rob thirlby  but fiji rallied to force a tense finale. scotland were beaten 33-15 by samoa in the plate semi-final and ireland lost 17-5 to tunisia in the shield final. mike friday s england side matched their opponents for pace  power and skill in the final and led 19-7 at half-time. but neumi nanuku and marika vakacegu touched down for fiji  only for a needless trip by tuidriva bainivalu on geoff appleford to allow england to run down the clock.  to be honest  england have wanted to win in dubai for a very long time now  and the people here have wanted us to win for just as long   said friday.   we didn t want to put pressure on ourselves but we are thankful we have achieved that and brought through some young talent at the same time that can hopefully play for the england  15s  in a few years.  portugal confirmed their impressive progress in sevens rugby by recording a sudden-death win over france in the bowl final. samoa won the plate title by edging out argentina 21-19.
bush website blocked outside us surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re-election site of president george w bush.  the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning. since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it. the blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers  but as a result of a policy decision by the bush camp.  the international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london  amsterdam and sydney failed.  by contrast netcraft s four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems. the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us. some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site. the pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers. geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. on 21 october  the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages  videos and other content on its site reaches visitors. mike prettejohn  president of netcraft  speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs  and traffic  in the run-up to the election on 2 november. he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. however  simply blocking non-us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too. akamai declined to comment  saying it could not talk about customer websites.
ray dvd beats box office takings oscar-nominated film biopic ray has surpassed its us box office takings with a combined tally of $80m (£43m) from dvd and video sales and rentals.  ray s success on dvd outstripped its $74m (£40m) us box office total  earning more than $40m (£22m) on the first day of the dvd s release alone. ray has been nominated in six oscar categories including best film and best actor for jamie foxx. the film recounts the life of blues singer ray charles  who died in 2004. in its first week on home entertainment release the film was the number one selling dvd  with the limited edition version coming in at number 11. sony horror film the grudge  starring michelle gellar  was the us  second best-selling dvd  with jennifer lopez and richard gere s romantic comedy shall we dance  at number three. foxx s critically acclaimed performance as ray has already earned him a screen actors guild award for best actor  as well as a prestigious golden globe. ray director taylor hackford  responsible for the classic 1982 film an officer and a gentleman  has also received an oscar nomination in the best director category. the film s three other oscar nominations are for costume  film editing and sound mixing.
seamen sail into biometric future the luxury cruise liner crystal harmony  currently in the gulf of mexico  is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology.  as holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes  their ship s crew is testing prototype versions of the world s first internationally issued biometric id cards  the seafarer s equivalent of a passport. along with the owner s picture  name and personal details  the new seafarers  identity document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder s fingerprints. the cards are due to be issued in february next year  in line with the revised un convention on seafarers  identity documents of june 2003. tests currently under way in the caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers  produced by different companies in different countries  are working to interoperable standards. results of the current tests  which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities  will be published by the international labour organisation (ilo) by the end of november. crystal cruises  which operates the crystal harmony  is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology.  authenti-corp  the us technology consultancy  has been working with the ilo on its technical specifications for the cards.   if you re issued a seafarer s id in your country  you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in  say  my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed   authenti-corp s ceo  cynthia musselman  told the bbc s go digital programme. she said french  jordanian and nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new id cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. it aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. the convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor s wellbeing and  therefore  it says  to safer shipping and cleaner oceans.  by increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection  the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world   said ms musselman.  it should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in  and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are  in fact  seafarers.
election  could be terror target  terrorists might try to target the uk in the run-up to the election  london s most senior police officer has said.  sir ian blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the madrid bomb on spain s general election last year. other potential targets were the royal wedding and the uk s presidency of the european union and g8  he said. he refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack. no 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real.  the comments come after tony blair defended his controversial anti-terror proposals  warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting. sir ian told a meeting of the metropolitan police authority it would be  unwise  to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack. but he said:  terrorists have long memories. they understand what happened in madrid and know what the impact of that was on the spanish electorate.   this year we are responsible for the eu presidency  presidency of the g8  a royal wedding and a general election.  there are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with.  sir ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians  not the police  who would enforce any new powers.  home secretary charles clarke has also warned that a madrid-style pre-election bombing could happen in the uk too. asked about sir ian s comments  the prime minister s official spokesman said:  we believe the threat is real.  the spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign. he said no 10 did not disclose any security advice they received. earlier  writing in the daily telegraph  the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were  difficult issues for any government . the commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition  with the government s majority more than halved as 32 labour rebels joined tory and lib dem opposition. but mr blair insisted:  there is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack.   tory leader michael howard has accused mr blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of  using national security for political point scoring . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy says that the plan is a further example of labour s  authoritarian  response to crises. the prevention of terrorism bill proposes  control orders   which as well as house arrest could impose curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against. but critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders. the plans face further commons scrutiny on monday before passing to the lords.
t-mobile bets on  pocket office  t-mobile has launched its latest  pocket office  third-generation (3g) device which also has built-in wi-fi - high-speed wireless net access.  unlike other devices where the user has to check which high-speed network is available to transfer data  the device selects the fastest one itself. the mda iv  released in the summer  is an upgrade to the company s existing smartphone  the 2.5g/wi-fi mda iii. it reflects the push by mobile firms for devices that are like mini laptops. the device has a display that can be swivelled and angled so it can be used like a small computer  or as a conventional clamshell phone. the microsoft mobile phone  with two cameras and a qwerty keyboard  reflects the design of similar all-in-one models released this year  such as motorola s mpx.  one in five european workers are already mobile - meaning they spend significant time travelling and out of the office   rene obermann  t-mobile s chief executive  told a press conference at the 3gsm trade show in cannes. he added:  what they need is their office when they are out of the office.  t-mobile said it was seeing increasing take up for what it calls  office in a pocket  devices  with 100 000 mdas sold in europe already.  in response to demand  t-mobile also said it would be adding the latest phone-shaped blackberry to its mobile range. reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office  it announced it would introduce a flat-fee £20 ($38) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the uk using its wi-fi hotspots. it said it would nearly double the number of its hotspots - places where wi-fi access is available - globally from 12 300 to 20 000.  it also announced it was installing high-speed wi-fi on certain train services  such as the uk s london to brighton service  to provide commuters a fast net connection too. the service  which has been developed with southern trains  nomad digital (who provide the technology)  begins with a free trial on 16 trains on the route from early march to the end of april. a full service is set to follow in the summer. wi-fi access points will be connected to a wimax wireless network - faster than wi-fi - running alongside the train tracks. brian mcbride  managing director of t-mobile in the uk  said:  we see a growing trend for business users needing to access e-mail securely on the move.   we are able to offer this by maintaining a constant data session for the entire journey.  he said this was something other similar in-train wi-fi services  such as that offered on gner trains  did not offer yet. mr obermann added that the mobile industry in general was still growing  with many more opportunities for more services which would bear fruit for mobile companies in future. thousands of mobile industry experts are gathered in cannes  france  for the 3gsm which runs from 14 to 17 february.
old firm pair handed suspensions celtic s henri camara and nacho novo of rangers have both been suspended for offences missed by the referee in a recent old firm game.  both were given automatic one-match bans and 12 additional disciplinary points for their actions. that means novo will miss a further two games because of his prior record. camara will miss one additional game. novo was found guilty of stamping on celtic s stephen pearson. camara was punished for kicking gregory vignal.  i m extremely disappointed. i don t know if there s a lot to add to that   said rangers manager alex mcleish of novo s punishment.  but what i will say is that i m at a loss as to why that incident should be picked up and highlighted when there were so many other incidents during the game.  both players will miss this weekend s games when celtic host dundee united and rangers visit kilmarnock unless they decide to appeal.  the additional bans come into effect from 28 december meaning camara will also be unavailable for the home game against livingston while novo will miss the meetings with dundee united and dunfermline. an sfa spokesman said:  they have seven days to appeal but with matches coming along at the weekend they would need to do so before friday.  but if they do appeal it won t be heard before this weekend because it takes a bit of time to seat up an appeals tribunal.  meanwhile  bob malcolm and rangers have been informed by letter as to the outcome of the hearing regarding his reaction to rangers being awarded a penalty in the same game. malcolm  a substitute on the day  was taken from the rangers dug-out and spoken to by police about an alleged gesture he made. but the sfa would not detail what  if any  punishment malcolm would receive.  once rangers receive our letter we will be in a position to make a comment on the findings   added the spokesman.
german business confidence slides german business confidence fell in february knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in europe s largest economy.  munich-based research institute ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in february from 97.5 in january  its first decline in three months. the study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.   we re surprised that the ifo index has taken such a knock   said dz bank economist bernd weidensteiner.  the main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak  particularly in the retail trade.  economy and labour minister wolfgang clement called the dip in february s ifo confidence figure  a very mild decline . he said that despite the retreat  the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected  a modest economic upswing  to continue.  germany s economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. however  the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004  mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and ifo president hans-werner sinn said any improvement in german domestic demand was sluggish. exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004  but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making german products less competitive overseas. on top of that  the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms  including daimlerchrysler  siemens and volkswagen  have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. analysts said that the ifo figures and germany s continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the european central bank. eurozone interest rates are at 2%  but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation  prompting fears that interest rates may rise.
scotland 18-10 italy six chris paterson penalties gave scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against italy at murrayfield.  coach matt williams  side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and scotland were denied a try when wing sean lamont s touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. a late andrea masi try was small consolation for italy  chasing their first away win in the six nations. scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back paterson. but the more powerful azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.  a series of drives into scottish territory set up a penalty attempt  missed by full-back roland de marigny  and a wayward drop-goal effort from luciano orquera. scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes italy  after coming up yards short of the line  equalised through a de marigny penalty. italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the left-footed de marigny pushed his kick wide. scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.  as the half wore on  both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties  and the period fizzled out with scotland numerically  if not psychologically  on top. italy s de marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. and scotland capitalised with a third paterson penalty on 50 minutes. williams  side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and  after a couple of probing attacks  paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.  with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland  lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from paterson. another paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. but john kirwan s men had the last laugh when gordon ross  attempted clearance was charged down and masi pounced for the try  converted by de marigny.  : c paterson; s webster  a craig  h southwell  s lamont; d parks  c cusiter; t smith  g bulloch (capt)  g kerr; s grimes  s murray; s taylor  j petrie  a hogg.  r russell  b douglas  n hines  j dunbar  m blair  g ross  b hinshelwood.  r de marigny; mirco bergamasco  c stoica  a masi  l nitoglia; l orquera  a troncon; a lo cicero  f ongaro  m castrogiovanni; s dellape  m bortolami (capt); a persico  d dal maso  s parisse.  g intoppa  s perugini  ca del fava  s orlando  p griffen  r pedrazzi  kp robertson.

spam e-mails tempt net shoppers computer users across the world continue to ignore security warnings about spam e-mails and are being lured into buying goods  a report suggests.  more than a quarter have bought software through spam e-mails and 24% have bought clothes or jewellery. as well as profiting from selling goods or services and driving advertising traffic  organised crime rings can use spam to glean personal information. the business software alliance (bsa) warned that people should  stay alert .  many online consumers don t consider the true motives of spammers   said mike newton  a spokesperson for the bsa which commissioned the survey.   by selling software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites  spammers are hiding spyware without consumers  knowledge.  once the software is installed on pcs and networks  information that is given over the internet can be obtained and abused.   the results also showed that the proportion of people reading - or admitting to reading - and taking advantage of adult entertainment spam e-mails is low  at one in 10. the research  which covered 6 000 people in six countries and their attitudes towards junk e-mails  revealed that brazilians were the most likely to read spam. a third of them read unsolicited junk e-mail and 66% buy goods or services after receiving spam.  the french were the second most likely to buy something (48%)  with 44% of britons taking advantage of products and services. this was despite 38% of people in all countries being worried about their net security because of the amount of spam they get. more than a third of respondents said they were concerned that spam e-mails contained viruses or programs that attempted to collect personal information.  both industry and the media have helped to raise awareness of the issues that surround illegitimate e-mail  helping to reduce the potential financial damage and nuisance from phishing attacks and spoof websites   said william plante  director of corporate security and fraud protection at security firm symantec.  at the same time  consumers need to continue exercising caution and protect themselves from harm with a mixture of spam filters  spyware detection software and sound judgement.
o leary agrees new villa contract aston villa boss david o leary signed a three-and-a-half year contract extension on thursday  securing his future at the club until summer 2008.  o leary s future was in question  but villa chairman doug ellis said he was happy to secure the deal.  david s record since his arrival in 2003 is excellent and he shares the board s amibitions in taking this club forward   he told villa s website.  for this reason it was important we got this right.  o leary put pen to paper after deals were sorted for his right-hand men roy aitken and steve mcgregor.  it was important to me roy and steve  an integral part of my team  should stay for the same time   o leary said on thursday ahead of signing his new deal.  someone has to try and put aston villa back where they should belong and i m up for the challenge. earlier in december  there were rumours o leary would quit if he is not offered a new deal before the end of the season.  but he denied that  saying he was happy to take on the challenge of improving villa s fortunes in the long term.  i want to make sure by the end of the five years i would have been in charge that villa are achieving top six finishes in the premiership on a regular basis   said o leary  who took over at villa park in may 2003.  but to achieve that  and take the next step forward  we do need to bring in quality players.  i would like a couple next month if at all possible to set us on the way.  meanwhile  o leary has rapped skipper olof mellberg for his comments before sunday s derby with birmingham.  mellberg spoke of his dislike of villa s rivals ahead of the match  which steve bruce s side won 2-1.  i ve had more than a quiet word with olof. it s been said within the whole group  not as a one-to-one   he told villa s website.  you shouldn t leave yourself open to be shot down. you shouldn t give people the chance to take cheap shots at you and he set himself up for that.
net fingerprints combat attacks eighty large net service firms have switched on software to spot and stop net attacks automatically.  the system creates digital fingerprints of ongoing incidents that are sent to every network affected. firms involved in the smart sensing system believe it will help trace attacks back to their source. data gathered will be passed to police to help build up intelligence about who is behind worm outbreaks and denial of service attacks.  firms signing up for the sensing system include mci  bt  deutsche telekom  energis  ntt  bell canada and many others. the creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by us firm arbor networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack. increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites  launch worms and relay spam around the net.  we have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic   said rob pollard  sales director for arbor networks which is behind the fingerprinting system.  attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination   he said. once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem.  mr pollard said arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected.  what we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source   said mr pollard. arbor network s technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network. it spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups. any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a net-based attack of some kind. this type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines. anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack.  attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated   said malcolm seagrave  security expert at energis.  in the last 12 months it started getting noticeable that criminals were taking to it and we ve seen massive growth.  he said that although informal systems exist to pass on information about attacks  often commercial confidentiality got in the way of sharing enough information to properly combat attacks.

singer knight backs anti-gun song r&b star beverley knight said she sang on an anti-gun single after being  haunted  by the fatal 2003 shooting of two teenage girls in birmingham.  knight and drum  n  bass star roni size have released no more in a bid to reduce gun use among young people. she said she was  horrified  by the deaths of charlene ellis  18  and letisha shakespeare  17. size  whose new forms album won the 1997 mercury music prize  said gun use was  nothing to be glamorised .  there were more than 10 500 firearms offences and 70 gun crime deaths in england and wales between june 2003 and 2004  according to home office figures. knight said the scale of the problem became clear to her after the 2003 shootings in aston  near knight s birmingham home.   it haunted me to be honest  it haunted my sleep   she said. size became involved after two friends  donna small and asha jama  were shot in his bristol hometown in october. jama  25  lost her sight in one eye while 22-year-old small suffered serious head injuries. size said he collaborated on the single  which was released on monday  because he has  a bird s eye view of what s going on .  over the last 10 years  i have seen a lot of things happen and it is nothing to be glamorised  it really isn t   he said.
us firm pulls out of iraq a us company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild iraq s transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts  pentagon officials have said.  contrack international  of arlington  virginia  heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes. its withdrawal from the $325m (£170m) contract in november is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. contrack said  the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner . but the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from iraq.  members of the joint venture including contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts  are actively working in iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country   it said in a statement. the pentagon s project and contract office (pco) in baghdad said it had taken over contrack s management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.  us firms and their workers have been targets of attacks  and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in iraq. of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by congress  less than $2bn has been spent. lt col eric schnaible of the pco told the associated press news agency contrack s withdrawal from the transportation contract was a  mutually agreed-to separation  and did not indicate a movement by us companies to leave iraq.  some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others   he added.  where we can get the work done  good things are happening.
saudi ministry to employ women women will be employed in saudi arabia s foreign ministry for the first time this year  foreign minister prince saud al-faisal has been reported as saying.  the move comes as the conservative country inches open the door to working women. last year  crown prince abdullah  the de-facto ruler  told government departments to put plans in place for employing women. but progress has been slow  reports from the country say.  earlier this week  the local arab news said labour minister ghazi al-gosaibi had  caused uproar  when he said his ministry was having difficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices. the newspaper said many saudi women found his explanation  a pitiful excuse for not employing women . women now make up more than half of all graduates from saudi universities but only 5% of the workforce.  our educational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and professionally trained saudi women who are acquiring their rightful position in saudi society   arab news quoted prince saud as saying.  i am proud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the ministry of foreign affairs for the first time.
candidate resigns over bnp link a prospective candidate for the uk independence party (ukip) has resigned after admitting a  brief attachment  to the british national party(bnp).  nicholas betts-green  who had been selected to fight the suffolk coastal seat  quit after reports in a newspaper that he attended a bnp meeting. the former teacher confirmed he had attended the meeting but said that was the only contact he had with the group. mr betts-green resigned after being questioned by the party s leadership. a ukip spokesman said mr betts-green s resignation followed disclosures in the east anglian daily times last month about his attendance at a bnp meeting.  he did once attend a bnp meeting. he did not like what he saw and heard and will take no further part of it   the spokesman added. a meeting of suffolk coastal ukip members is due to be held next week to discuss a replacement. mr betts-green  of woodbridge  suffolk  has also resigned as ukip s branch chairman.
tories plan migrant health checks non-european union citizens wanting to work in the uk will have to undergo tests for tuberculosis and hiv  under plans unveiled by the conservatives.  a positive test for tb would mean visa applications being turned down  while hiv would be dealt with case by case. leader michael howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the nhs. labour said many tests were already done. the lib dems warned both parties against  pandering to prejudice .  the proposals  which would be brought in if the conservatives won the general election  would not apply to people coming to the uk for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. mr howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in canada  new zealand and australia.  it s very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that britain enjoys   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme. government figures suggest tb in england has increased by 25% over the past 10 years.  nearly two thirds of people with tb are born abroad   said mr howard.   i don t think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem.  but mr howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants  claims. the proposals include:  - people coming to the uk from outside the eu for between six and 12 months from a  high incidence tb country  will have to undergo a chest x-ray.   - people coming to settle in the uk permanently from outside the eu will have to  demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health .   - they will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to  impose significant costs or demands  on the nhs.   - the tests will include a health check  chest x-rays for tb (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and hiv for over 16-year-olds. only the discovery of tb will mean people will be automatically denied a visa  other conditions will be dealt with on a  case by case basis .  there is already some screening in place. last year 185 000 people were tested for tb at heathrow and gatwick airports  only about 200 were found to be infected. and dr john moore-gillon  of the british lung foundation  said:  tb is not simply imported  we are seeing a rise in many sections of the uk-born population as well.  the government says the tories are  a bit late  to the issue. immigration minister des browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum  as saying:  we are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for tb in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage.  those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk.  meanwhile mark oaten  liberal democrat home affairs spokesman  said:  this is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between labour and the conservatives.  michael howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing  and history proves it is a very dangerous one.  lisa power  head of policy at aids charity the terrence higgins trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based.  in fact  it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their eu status   she said.

dominici backs lacklustre france wing christophe dominici says france can claim another six nations grand slam despite two lacklustre wins so far against scotland and england.  the champions only just saw off the scots in paris  then needed england to self-destruct in last week s 18-17 win.  the english played better than us but lost  whereas we are still in the race for the grand slam   said dominici.  we know our display was not perfect  but we can still win the grand slam  along with ireland and wales.  france   ireland and wales all remain unbeaten after two rounds of this year s rbs six nations  with the two celtic nations playing by far the more impressive rugby.  france take on wales at the stade de france on 26 february and ireland in dublin on 12 march. but although france have yet to click  dominici says that they can still win the hard way as long as scrum-half dimitri yachvili continues in his goalkicking form.  if we have an efficient kicker on whom we can rely on  a solid defence and a team who play for their lives  we can achieve something   dominici added.  i said at the start of the competition that the winners would be clearer from the third matches  and that s exactly what is going to happen.  france coach bernard laporte will announce his starting line-up next tuesday for the match against wales.  wing jimmy marlu is definitely out with the knee injury sustained at twickenham  which is likely to sideline him for the rest of the tournament. inspirational flanker serge betsen is a doubt with a thigh injury  but number eight imanol harinordoquy has shaken off his shoulder injury. in the backs  centre yannick jauzion and winger aurelien rougerie are all back in contention after injury  while brive back julien laharrague has received his first call-up as a replacement for pepito elhorga.
ultimate game  award for doom 3 sci-fi shooter doom 3 has blasted away the competition at a major games ceremony  the golden joystick awards.  it was the only title to win twice  winning ultimate game of the year and best pc game at the awards  presented by little britain star matt lucas. the much-anticipated sci-fi horror doom 3 shot straight to the top of the uk games charts on its release in august. other winners included grand theft auto: san andreas which took the most wanted for christmas prize. only released last week  it was closely followed by halo 2 and half-life 2  which are expected to be big hits when they are unleashed later this month.  but they missed out on the prize for the most wanted game of 2005  which went to the nintendo title  the legend of zelda. the original doom  released in 1994  heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3d graphics. it helped to establish the concept of the first-person shooter. doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (£8.3m). the top honour for the best online game of the year went to battlefield vietnam. the chronicles of riddick: escape from butcher bay was handed the unsung hero game of 2004. its release was somewhat eclipsed by doom 3  which was released on the same week. it was  however  very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time. electronic arts was named top publisher of the year  taking the crown from nintendo which won in 2003. the annual awards are voted for by more than 200 000 readers of computer and video games magazines. games awards like this have grown in importance. over the last six years  the uk market for games grew by 100% and was worth a record £1 152m in 2003  according to a recent report by analysts screen digest.
retail sales show festive fervour uk retail sales were better than expected in november as christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the high street  figures show.  the office for national statistics (ons) said retail sales rose 0.6% on the month and 6.1% on the year. but the figures  along with this week s inflation report  could trigger another interest rate rise in the new year. however  recent data from the british retail consortium showed a 0.2% slip in high street sales during november.  the ons data confounded analyst expectations. many had expected sales to fall slightly in november as shoppers put off buying christmas presents until december. however  retailers  attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind november s unexpected rise in sales  they say. aggressive tactics  such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as marks & spencer  appear to have paid off.  price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn t grown as much as volumes   said investec economist david page. the figures sparked a rally for sterling as the data supported the view that it is too early to assume that base rates have peaked.
ukip outspent labour on eu poll the uk independence party outspent both labour and the liberal democrats in the european elections  new figures show.  ukip  which campaigned on a slogan of  say no to europe   spent £2.36m on the campaign - second only to the conservatives  £3.13m. the campaign took ukip into third place with an extra 10 meps. labour s campaign cost £1.7m  the lib dems  £1.19m and the greens  £404 000  according to figures revealed by the electoral commission on wednesday. much of the ukip funding came from yorkshire millionaire sir paul sykes  who helped bankroll the party s billboard campaign. critics have accused the party of effectively buying votes. but a ukip spokesman said labour and the conservatives had spent £10m between them on the last general election.  with the advantages of public money the others have  the only way the smaller parties can get their message across is by buying the advertising space   he added.
wilkinson to miss ireland match england will have to take on ireland in the six nations without captain and goal-kicker jonny wilkinson  according to his newcastle boss rob andrew.  wilkinson - who had targeted the 27 february match for his international comeback - has been missed by england  not least for his goal-kicking.  jonny s not fit yet   falcons chief andrew told bbc radio five live.  he won t be fit for dublin  there s no doubt about that  but he might be fit for scotland and italy.  the 25-year-old has not played for england since the 2003 world cup final after a succession of injuries. england  who have lost three six nations games in a row  wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to france. goal-kickers charlie hodgson and olly barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop-goal between them.  they ve probably got two of the best english kickers in the premiership in hodgson and barkley   added andrew  a former england fly-half and goal-kicker.   they re both pretty good kickers. charlie is a good kicker week-in  week-out.  but it s all about pressure and unfortunately england are just not handling the pressure at the moment.  andrew also blamed england s poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries.  they just didn t have that leadership that would have seen them through. martin johnson  lawrence dallaglio and jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations   he said.  i think it is really difficult for jason robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back.  meanwhile  former england full-back dusty hare put england s mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness.   jonny wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate   hare told bbc radio five live.  but natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do.  you have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts.  hodgson  who has an excellent kicking record with club side sale sharks  has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late.  the top golfers don t hit the fairway every time  and it is the same with goal-kicking   hare added.  you need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over  but great goal-kickers like jonny wilkinson come along very rarely.
apple mac mini gets warm welcome the mac mini has been welcomed by apple fans  industry experts and pc users.  the release of the tiny  low-cost machine is seen as a good move for apple which currently has a small share of the desktop computer market. mac watchers and some analysts say the mac mini will go a long way to help apple appeal to the mass of consumers. they speculate that the mac mini will be bought by ipod owners and those wanting an easy-to-use and administer second home computer.   it s the bravest move they have made yet   said jonny evans  news editor at macworld magazine. mr evans said the combination of low cost  small size and huge numbers of ipod users could make it a big success.  he thought that the machine would appeal to those that like apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware.  it s deeply affordable   he said.  plus you know that you do not get viruses or all of the associated problems.  already  he said  pc owning friends had declared that they would be buying one. interest in the new products launched at macworld expo was so strong that websites for apple s store and the show struggled to cope with demand. according to response statistics gathered by netcraft many visiting the apple store in the wake of mr jobs  speech suffered lengthy response times. the macworld expo site was completely overwhelmed and went offline.   i think fundamentally it s a good idea because it s cheap even for a pc   said nick ross  deputy labs editor at pc pro. apple s work on making things easy to use would also help the mac mini win fans  he said.  i think people expect it just to work now and really it should   hesaid. the mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer  he said.  for browsing the web  e-mail and all kinds of basic duties it s going to be absolutely adequate   said mr ross. ian fogg  broadband and personal technology analyst at jupiter research  agreed that the mac mini could be very popular.  apple has been hoping that sales of the ipod will have a halo effect on the sales of the mac   he said.  before now  he said  apple has been seen as a premium brand. but  he said  the mac mini changed that perception.  it s a particularly good price when you see that it s apple that is doing it   he said. apple expects the mac mini to sell for £339 in the uk and $499 in the us. adding extras such as a larger hard drive  more memory and networking options will increase the basic price. it will go on sale from 22 january.  for consumers interested in style  design and small size - which is what the majority of ipod customers are interested in - it s a natural next step   said mr fogg. apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at  said mr fogg  who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction.  his only misgivings were over how easy other consumers  other than ipod owners  would find using the machine. he said anyone wanting to use the mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor.  they d be much more likely to pair a mac mini with a lcd or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost   he said. those with flat screens and lcd monitors are likely to have bought them recently and not be in the market for a new machine.  there are also questions over whether the mac mini will work with very old peripherals  such as display  keyboard and mouse. the mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music  movies and images people accumulate  said mr fogg.  the mac mini is not quite ready for that yet   he said.  it does not have the right connectors that fit a tv screen or enough storage.  said mr fogg:  it s very much a computer.  one dissenting opinion came from brian gammage  vice-president of research at analysts gartner. he said:  i don t think it changes the world.  although the mac mini was very cheap for an apple computer  it was still expensive compared to many pcs. also  he said  it appealed in categories that few consumers care about when buying a home computer.  the pc world is a pile-em-high  sell-em-cheap market   he said   and all of them are pretty interchangeable.   since the days when apple ruled the personal computing world its market share has been on a long  slow decline   he said.  every few years it does something to give its market share a kick then it starts to go back down again   said mr gammage. the release of the mac mini fit perfectly with this trend  he said.
blair rejects tory terror offer tony blair has rejected a conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti-terror legislation.  the tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the anti-terrorism bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in november. mr blair said the bill  which brings in house arrest for terror suspects  had time limiting safeguards already. the tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. the lib dems also oppose the plans.  the government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases.  mr blair s refusal to accept the tories  sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the lords. peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on thursday. the bill proposes  control orders   which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. these would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.  the tories want judicial oversight of all control orders  not just house arrest. shadow home secretary david davis told bbc radio four s the world at one his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. he said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a  recruiting sergeant  for terrorists. he went on to say:  if we don t get the amendments we regard as essential  including the sunset clause  we will vote against the bill.  in the commons  mr howard said it would be  far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through . mr blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.  the second  less stringent  type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by  an eminent and independent person .  i believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that i will not put at risk   said mr blair. the lib dems plan to oppose the bill in the lords on thursday. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  there s a lot of talking left. i would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months.  a spokeswoman for human rights watch said it was a  basic principle  that people should only be punished after a fair trial. she added:  having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.
mcconnell details scots wave toll at least three people from scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list  the first minister has told msps.  the figures came out during a statement by jack mcconnell to the scottish parliament on wednesday. he formally expressed scotland s sympathy for the victims of the indian ocean tidal wave which killed 150 000. mr mcconnell went on to promise that scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort. he said the provisional figures on the dead and lost had been provided by the police.  mr mcconnell said the tragedy should persuade everyone to step up the fight against global poverty and change the world for the better. he said he was proud of the generous response of people in scotland to the disaster appeal  which is expected soon to top £20m. the first minister also praised scottish water for immediately flying bottled water and five large generators to the disaster zone. the scottish executive has seconded 11 staff to the aid agencies.  but he said scotland was  in it for the long term  with help planned for fishing communities  for children s services  and for the aid charities. he said 2005 must be the year that scotland showed clearly it cared for what happened to people elsewhere in the world  whether in asia or in africa. mr mcconnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the make poverty history campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities  trade unions and churches in the run-up to the g8 summit in gleneagles in july. edinburgh architect  dominic stephenson  became the first scot to be confirmed as a victim of the asian tsunami. the 27-year-old was holidaying on the thai island of koh phi phi with eileen lee  24. she is still missing.
economy  strong  in election year uk businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises  according to a report.  optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending  say researchers at bdo stoy hayward. the bank of england is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in may. the bdo optimism index - a leading indicator of gdp growth two quarters ahead edged up in january to 102.5  from 102.2 in october. the rise is due  in part  to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.  the only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election  bdo said. its bdo s output index - which predicts gdp movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for january  implying gdp growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. however  the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises  sterling s strength against the dollar and high oil prices  the group noted. its inflation index  which has risen continuously over the last 8 months  climbed to 110.0 in january from 108.0 in october last year.  the uk is looking strong going into the general election  but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the bank of england reacts to growth and inflationary pressures   said peter hemington  partner at bdo stoy hayward.  growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.
golden economic period  to end ten years of  golden  economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly  city consultancy deloitte has warned.  the uk economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market  triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment. deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year  below chancellor gordon brown s forecast of 3% to 3.5%. it also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year.  in its quarterly economic review  deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a  golden period  during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.  but it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major  imbalances  in the economy. deloitte s chief economic advisor roger bootle said:  the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown.  whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth  this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.   economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes  deloitte believes. gordon brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term  the firm claims. this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year  when the economy expanded by 3.25%. however  deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the bank of england to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. it expects a series of  aggressive  interest rate cuts over the next two years  with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006.  although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong  it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the uk economy   mr bootle.
bellamy fined after row newcastle have fined their welsh striker craig bellamy two weeks  wages - about £80 000 - following his row with manager graeme souness.  but bellamy  25  has not been put on the transfer list  although he did not train with the first team on tuesday. magpies chairman freddy shepherd told the newcastle evening chronicle:  it is not about money. it is about a player thinking he is bigger than this club.  no individual is  be it the chairman  the manager or a player.  souness dropped bellamy for sunday s game against arsenal  claiming the welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position.  when i heard what the manager was saying i was in shock   bellamy said.  i thought  not only has he gone behind my back  he s lying    he said in response to souness  remarks. and the wales international refused to apologise.  i won t apologise because i have done nothing wrong   he told the evening chronicle.  there s no doubt about it  i am out of here.  the difficult relationship between souness and bellamy boiled over at the weekend  and has led to a war of words in the media.  bellamy s claim that souness had lied about the background to the bust-up was strongly denied by shepherd  who accused the striker of  cheating  the club.  i wish to put the record straight regarding the bellamy situation   said shepherd.  craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring was tight (on friday)  but what he failed to reveal was that he had told other members of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury.  when graeme discovered this he immediately ordered bellamy to attend a meeting in my office.  at that meeting bellamy admitted to graeme and i that he had told the players that he was going to  fake  an injury in training and walk off.  he also agreed at that meeting to apologise to his team-mates for his behaviour. he didn t do this which resulted in the action taken by the manager at the weekend  which i fully support.  in my book this is cheating on the club  the supporters  the manager and his own team-mates.  he is paid extremely well and i consider his behaviour to be totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional.   bellamy s latest outburst would appear to make his chances of a first-team recall remote. but even before newcastle said the player would not be sold  bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in a transfer request.  i don t want the fans to think for one minute that i wouldn t play for this club   he said.  i d play anywhere for this club  even in goal.  it s a very difficult situation for me at the moment but i d never ask to leave this club.  this club means so much to me. i couldn t do it because i know i couldn t come back here and play against newcastle. it would hurt too much.
labour seeks to quell feud talk labour s leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after mps criticised tony blair and gordon brown over reports of their rift.  mr brown was joined at the launch by john prescott and alan milburn  the man controversially put in charge of election planning by mr blair. a private meeting on monday saw normally loyal mps warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. it follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.  the event was the first time mr milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking mr brown s traditional poll planning role. but the pair chatted amicably and mr brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister  mr brown replied:  you can see that our record on the economy is about the british people trusting us to run the economy.   he refused to comment on the new book  saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. mr brown later told reporters:  of course i trust the prime minister.  downing street cited that comment when reporters  suggested mr brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told mr blair:  there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe . labour s new posters say britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s  lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. they urge voters not to let the tories take things backwards. mr milburn promised a poll campaign  which is upbeat  confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country .  conservative co-chairman liam fox derided the photo call  saying:  the show of unity was the worst acting i have seen since prisoner cell block h.  labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the english-speaking world  he said.  the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday s meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made in journalist robert peston s new book. mr blair told mps and peers:  i know from everyone here  in cabinet and government  nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.  labour s paul flynn said the pair had had a  scorching  from mps.  on tuesday  deputy prime minister mr prescott told bbc news:  they told us very clearly  it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.  the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november 2003 where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war. mr blair then changed his mind in june 2004  after cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him  writes mr peston. mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential.  of course as a waiter for 10 years i have a professional ability here   he joked.
young debut cut short by ginepri fifteen-year-old donald young s first appearance in an atp tennis tournament proved brief as the teenager went out in round one of the san jose open.  young shot to the top of the junior world rankings when he won the boys  singles at january s australian open. but the wildcard entry was dispatched by fellow american robby ginepri in straight sets  6-2 6-2  in california. despite that he was happy with his tour debut.  it was fun. i had my chances  but they didn t come through   he said. young  who beat two players ranked in the top 200 when he was just 14  was only 2-1 down in the first set before losing 10 of the next 13 games. and ginepri - six years older than the youngest player to ever win a junior slam and top the global standings - admitted he was impressed.   he s very talented   said ginepri.  he s got a long future ahead of him.  being left-handed  he was very quick around the court.  his serve is a little deceptive. he came into the net and volleyed better than i thought.  earlier  south korean hyung-taik lee defeated american jan-michael gambill 6-3 7-6 (7-4). american kevin kim defeated jan hernych of the czech republic 7-5 6-3  canadian qualifier frank dancevic downed american jeff morrison 4-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-0  and denmark s kenneth carlsen beat irakli labadze of the republic of georgia 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-3. top seed andy roddick launches his defence of the title on wednesday against qualifier paul goldstein. second seed andre agassi opens his campaign on tuesday against wildcard bobby reynolds  last year s us collegiate champion. agassi has won the san jose five times  but his run of three straight titles ended last year when he fell to mardy fish in the semi-finals. fish went on to lose to roddick in the final.

rocker doherty in on-stage fight rock singer pete doherty has been involved in a fight with his band s guitarist at their biggest gig to date.  babyshambles played for 5 000 fans at london s brixton academy on tuesday. the former libertines singer traded blows with guitarist patrick walden. they were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. the show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. on monday doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court  which he denies. he is out on £50 000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 gmt curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the brixton gig.  babyshambles  which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the libertines  played a warm-up show at the garage  north london  on monday. on tuesday  doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by mick jones  the former clash guitarist who produced the libertines  second album. babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 gmt  launching into their last single  killamangiro  which reached number eight in december. but the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. doherty appealed to fans to calm down  saying:  there s a few people getting hurt down the front  you ve got to move back.   the music resumed minutes later but after several more songs  the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect walden s guitar  leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage  but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. doherty  25  had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew  which is one of the conditions of his bail. on monday  the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were  not too regular an occurrence . the singer was arrested with fellow musician alan wass on 2 february after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker max carlish at a london hotel. they are next due in court on 18 april.
game makers get xbox 2 sneak peek microsoft has given game makers a glimpse of the new xbox 2 console.  some details of the xbox s performance and what gaming will be like with the device were given at the annual game developers conference in the us. xbox frontman j. allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second. also all titles for the new xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games.  microsoft is saving the official unveiling of the xbox 2  codenamed xenon  for the e3 show in may and the device could be on shop shelves by november. however  during his keynote speech at gdc mr allard  who heads development of game-making tools for the console  gave a glimpse into how some of its core software will work. he said gaming was entering a  high-definition  era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the hdtv people were starting to watch as well as the hd dvds that will soon start to appear.  industry watchers took this to mean that the xbox 2 will push for hdtv quality graphics as standard as well as multi-channel audio to give gamers an authentic experience. mr allard said microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the xbox 2 and for players to get playing. to this end microsoft was building in to xbox hardware systems to support headset chat  buddy list controls and custom soundtracks so developers were free to concentrate on the games. the xbox would also support well-known industry specifications  such as directx  to make it simple for game studios to make titles for the console. for gamers this emphasis on ease of use would mean every xbox title uses the same interface to set up online play and get at music stored on the hardware. this interface will hold details of a player s statistics and skill level on a  gamer card  as well as give access to a store where people can spend small amounts of cash to buy extras for their avatars or add-ons  such as new maps or vehicles  for games they possess. this ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future  said mr allard. only with such consistency would the xbox be able to support the 10-20 million subscribers that it was aiming for  said mr allard. during his speech mr allard took several swipes at the playstation and said processors for consoles had to be made with developers  not just engineers  in mind.  our approach is bruce lee  not brute force   he said.
takeover offer for sunderland fc bob murray  chairman of sunderland fc  has launched a £1.5m ($2.8m) bid for the club after buying broadcaster bskyb s stake in the business.  mr murray is already sunderland s leading shareholder  holding a 37.6% stake  and now hopes to take full control of the championship side. mr murray said the club would find it easier to attract more investment by having a single majority owner. sunderland delisted its shares from the stock market in august.  a lifetime sunderland supporter and board director since 1984  mr murray agreed to buy bskyb s 4.76% holding in the wearside club on tuesday - taking his stake to 42.3%. under stock market rules  mr murray is required to make an offer for the remaining shares that he does not already own at the same price paid for the bskyb holding of 31p a share.  should the offer be fully accepted  mr murray said he expected to pay a maximum of £1.53m for the remaining shares. he also stressed that fans who wanted to keep in touch with the club s financial affairs could retain a small number of shares  enabling them to attend annual meetings.  the football sector is experiencing significant changes and uncertainty   mr murray said in a statement.  the recent speculation surrounding malcolm glazer and manchester united has shown the unsettling effect possible where there are a number of disparate interests   he added.  i believe that this offer will strengthen the company and remove the potential for that type of uncertainty.   sunderland were relegated from the premiership in 2003 but are currently pushing for promotion. the club managed to reduce its losses last year from £20.6m to £1.2m after selling a host of leading players. however  the club s turnover dropped sharply from £42.5m to £28.5m over the same period  because of a fall in broadcast revenues. bskyb bought its stake in sunderland in 1999 as part of a five year media partnership deal. the deal expired last month.
mourinho to escape fa charge chelsea boss jose mourinho will not face any football association action over the comments he made after their carling cup tie with manchester united.  mourinho intimated that united boss sir alex ferguson influenced referee neale barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half-time. but an fa spokesman told bbc sport:  we are not taking action over mourinho.  we have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required. that is the end of it.  mourinho was concerned that ferguson s conversation with barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official.  i see one referee in the first half and another in the second   said mourinho.  if the fa ask me what happened  i will tell them. what i saw and felt made it easier to understand a few things.   maybe when i turn 60 and have been managing in the same league for 20 years and have the respect of everybody i will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble a little bit.  the referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free-kicks. it was fault after fault  dive after dive.  but i know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half-time. he should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him  but there was also someone else.  referees chief keith hackett believes mourinho should retract his comments about ferguson and barry as he believes the blues boss has questioned their integrity.  i m hoping he might reconsider his comments  unfortunately this is the nature of the game   said hackett.  i don t want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers. for the second leg we have an experienced referee  and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing.  sometimes managers have grounds for comments  and i note that  but a referees integrity has been questioned  that is offensive and should be avoided. mr mourinho should look at the facts.  mourinho added that the match was entertaining for a goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final.  it s 0-0  so if we win we go through and if we get a draw we go to extra time   he said.  we have exactly the same chance we had before this game.  we are confident of getting a result but we know what manchester united is  a footballing power. it ll be difficult for us  but also for them.
kuznetsova  failed a drugs test  us open champion svetlana kuznetsova has tested positive for a banned drug  according to belgian authorities.  belgian sports minister claude eerdekens said that the russian world number five tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine on 19 december. kuznetsova was playing in an exhibition event in charleroi at the time. eerdekens said:  there is a problem. ephedrine was discovered. she remains innocent until proved guilty. she can ask for it to be tested again.  the situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the world anti-doping agency (wada)  the international tennis federation (itf) or the women s tennis accosiation (wta). the test was carried out by regional belgian authorities and kuznetsova has not yet been able to have a b sample tested.  speaking at the australian open on monday  before eerdekens identified her  kuznetsova said:  i m not worried. i m not using anything to push myself.  i have not been notified of any positive test  and i think it is unfair that it s come out the way it did.  eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last friday to the player s address in spain  as well as to the belgian prosecutors  office and the belgian and russian tennis federations. he conceded kuznetsova might have taken a medicine which contained the banned substance.  we have simply stated a fact   he said.  it is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after a procedure that respects the defence.   either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection.  however  kuznetsova s naming was condemned by russian tennis chief shamil tarpishchev.  first of all  this belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing  without any basic evidence   tarpishchev said.  we all know the basic principle in doping cases. if there is a positive sample  then they should notify the international tennis federation (itf) as well as the national federation within three days   he said.  this is not the case here. as of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials  nor did the itf.  today i called the itf headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it.  if wada (the world anti-doping agency) was behind the testing  then we would also have known something by now.  otherwise  all these looks to me as pure fiction and fabrication of the facts.
qantas sees profits fly to record australian airline qantas has posted a record fiscal first-half profit thanks to cost-cutting measures.  net profit in the six months ending 31 december rose 28% to a$458.4m ($357.6m; £191m) from a year earlier. analysts expected a figure closer to a$431m. qantas shares fell almost 3%  however  after it warned that earnings growth would slow in the second half. sales will dip by at least a$30m after the indian ocean tsunami devastated many holiday destinations  qantas said.   the tsunami affected travel patterns in ways that we were a bit surprised about   chief executive geoff dixon explained.  it certainly affected japanese travel into australia. as soon as the tsunami hit we saw ... a lessening with bookings for australia.  higher fuel costs also are expected to eat into earnings in coming months.  we don t have as much hedging benefit in the second half as we had in the first   said chief financial officer peter gregg. qantas is facing increased pressure from rivals such as low-cost carrier virgin blue and the australian government is in talks about whether to allow singapore airlines to fly between the australia and the us - one of qantas  key routes.  even so  the firm is predicting that full-year earnings will increase from the previous 12 months. analysts have forecast full-year profit will rise about 11% to around a$720 million ($563 million). qantas boss mr dixon also said he would be reviewing the group s cost-cutting measures. during the first six months of the fiscal year  qantas made savings of a$245m  and is on track to top its target of a$500m for the full year. last month  the company warned it may transfer as many as 7 000 jobs out australia  with mr dixon quoted as saying that the carrier could no longer afford to remain  all-australian .
pre-poll clash on tax and spend labour and the tories have clashed over tax and spending plans as the row over gordon brown s budget turned into a full scale pre-election battle.  tony blair claimed a tory government would  cut  £35bn from public services hitting schools  hospitals and police. tory chairman liam fox accused labour of  at best misrepresentation at worst a downright lie  and said the  smear  tactics were a sign of desperation. the lib dems accused mr brown of ducking the issue of council tax rises.  appearing together at a labour poster launch  the prime minister hailed his chancellor s  brilliant  performance. and he claimed the tories would cut £35bn from public services  which was the equivalent of sacking every doctor and teacher in the uk.  the tories said they would not cut spending but agreed public spending would increase more slowly under their plans - leading to a total of £33.5bn less spending than that anticipated by labour by 2011. but they say not a single doctor  teacher or nurse will be cut. dr fox said:  we have said we will be spending more  year on year over and above inflation.  and to call that a cut is at best a misrepresentation  at worst a downright lie.   tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin also predicted mr brown would have to raise taxes by £10bn or £11bn if labour was re-elected because he was borrowing and spending too much. for the lib dems  vince cable said the chancellor had failed to deal with the  looming problems  of revaluation of council tax bands which he argued would result in  massive increases  for some. mr brown and mr blair staged a show of unity on thursday morning  the day after the chancellor delivered a record-breaking ninth budget.  mr cable said taxation as a share of the economy would go up under all three of the main parties. the chancellor meanwhile insisted his spending plans were  affordable . in wednesday s budget  mr brown doubled the level at which homebuyers pay stamp duty  unveiled a rise in child tax credit and a £200 council tax refund for over-65s. defending the plans  he told today:  i will take no risks with the stability of the economy.  all our spending plans announced yesterday [wednesday]  including what we can do for pensioners  as well as for young families and on stamp duty and inheritance tax  all these are costed and affordable.  in a further sign  if any were needed  that the election is approaching  the house of commons authorities have formally told mps their offices will be  deep cleaned  during the three-week poll campaign. mr blair has yet to name the day - but it is widely expected to be 5 may.
mixed signals from french economy the french economy picked up speed at the end of 2004  official figures show - but still looks set to have fallen short of the government s hopes.  according to state statistics body insee  growth for the three months to december was a seasonally-adjusted 0.7-0.8%  ahead of the 0.6% forecast. if confirmed  that would be the best quarterly showing since early 2002. it leaves gdp up 2.3% for the full year  but short of the 2.5% which the french government had predicted.  despite the apparent shortfall in annual economic growth  the good quarterly figures - a so-called  flash estimate  - mark a continuing trend of improving indicators for the health of the french economy. the government is reiterating a 2.5% target for 2005  while the european central bank is making positive noises for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole. also on friday  france s industrial output for december was released  showing 0.7% growth.  the numbers are good   said david naude  economist at deutsche bank.  they send a positive signal of a rebound in output... and open the way for a continuation in that trend into the new year.  service sector activity improved in january  hitting a seven-month high. but unemployment remains high at about 10%.
criminal probe on citigroup deals traders at us banking giant citigroup are facing a criminal investigation in germany over a controversial bond deal.  the deal saw the sale of 11bn euros ($14.4bn; £7.6bn) of government bonds in a few minutes on 2 august  with 4bn euros-worth then bought back later. the move was widely criticised at the time  and now the german regulator has said it has found evidence of possible market manipulation. citigroup said it would continue to co-operate fully with the authorities.  we are disappointed that the bafin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved   citigroup said. if the traders are found guilty  they could face a five-year jail term or a fine  reuters reported bafin as saying. however  under german criminal law  prosecutors cannot pursue citigroup itself.  germany s financial watchdog bafin told bbc news it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor.  i can confirm that bafin has passed through the case to the public prosecutor   a bafin spokeswoman said.  it is now a criminal investigation.   we found clues of possible market manipulation   the spokeswoman said  which included signs of linked bond trading ahead of the main trades on 2 august.  germany s securities trading act says that if bafin finds such clues  it has to put the case in the hands of the prosecutor.  regulatory investigations are still going on in france  the uk and elsewhere. some citigroup operations elsewhere in the world came under regulatory criticism in 2004. its private banking operation in japan was closed down by regulators in tokyo after an  aggressive sales culture  led the bank to flout anti-money laundering rules.
commodore finds new lease of life the once-famous commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a us-based digital music distributor.  new owner yeahronimo media ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of commodore computers. it also plans to develop a  worldwide entertainment concept  with the brand  although details are not yet known. the groundbreaking commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.  in the chronology of home computing  commodore was one of the pioneers.  the commodore 64  launched in 1982  was one of the first affordable home pcs. it was followed a few years later by the amiga. the commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system  even to this day. the brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. commodore international filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to dutch firm tulip computers. in the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to atari  which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games  formerly known as infogrames.  tulip computers sold several products under the commodore name  including portable usb storage devices and digital music players. it had planned to relaunch the brand  following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for windows pc  apple mac and even pdas so that the original commodore games can be still run. the sale of commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.
finding new homes for old phones re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment  it has social benefits too.  research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. the forum for the future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. but the forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites.  the report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk. of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year  only 25% get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. the slowly growing mass of unrecycled  discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets  the equivalent of 9 000 tonnes of waste  estimates james goodman  report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future.  it s quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around   said mr goodman.  many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world  said mr goodman. far better  he said  to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life.  we ve heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back   said mr goodman   but there s a strong social argument too.  older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. the forum for the future report took an in-depth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular.  it s an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network   said mr goodman   and there s a real desire for people to get mobile phones.  but the relatively low wages in romania  which is one of the poorest countries in europe  mean few people can afford a shiny new phone.  the affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one   he said. reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. the re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset. georgeta minciu  a romanian part-time cleaner  said:  normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. i am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me.   this is the only way i can afford to have a phone   she said. mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain s mobile mountain made it overseas. but  he added  those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset.  if its more than a few years old people are not going to want it   he said.
uk youth  interested  in politics the majority of young people are interested in politics  holding  strong opinions  on policies and have a  keen appetite  for direct action.  research undertaken for voting watchdog the electoral commission suggests 81% of 16 to 20-year-olds feel strongly about issues like crime and education. the survey findings are being released to coincide with the launch of the y vote mock elections 2005 initiative. mock elections are planned to take place in schools across the uk.  electoral commission boss sam younger said:  we know that young people often feel disengaged from democratic life and we believe in working creatively to encourage their interest and participation.  mock elections can play an extremely valuable role in helping young people understand how the democratic process works and why it matters   he said. the survey of a sample of 500 british 16 to 20-year-olds and 500 21 to 25-year olds  showed britain s young people are far from apathetic about issues that matter to most of their lives . the y vote initiative is being run jointly by the electoral commission  the hansard society and the department for education and skills in the run-up to local elections and the general election  possibly on 5 may. michael rafferty  who is mock elections project manager at the hansard society  said he looked forward to seeing schools and colleges across the uk participating in the mock votes.
barclays shares up on merger talk shares in uk banking group barclays have risen on monday following a weekend press report that it had held merger talks with us bank wells fargo.  a tie-up between barclays and california-based wells fargo would create the world s fourth biggest bank  valued at $180bn (£96bn). barclays has declined to comment on the report in the sunday express  saying it does not respond to market speculation. the two banks reportedly held talks in october and november 2004.  barclays shares were up 8 pence  or 1.3%  at 605 pence by late morning in london on monday  making it the second biggest gainer in the ftse 100 index. uk banking icon barclays was founded more than 300 years ago; it has operations in over 60 countries and employs 76 200 staff worldwide. its north american divisions focus on business banking  whereas wells fargo operates retail and business banking services from 6 000 branches. in 2003  barclays reported a 20% rise in pre-tax profits to £3.8bn  and it has recently forecast similar gains in 2004  predicting that full year pre-tax profits would rise 18% to £4.5bn. wells fargo had net income of $6.2bn in its last financial year  a 9% increase on the previous year  and revenues of $28.4bn. barclays was the focus of takeover speculation in august  when it was linked to citigroup  though no bid has ever materialised. stock market traders were sceptical that the latest reports heralded a deal.  the chief executive would be abandoning his duty if he didn t talk to rivals  but a deal doesn t seem likely   reuters quoted one trader as saying.
millions to miss out on the net by 2025  40% of the uk s population will still be without internet access at home  says a study.  around 23 million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information  predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to 27 million  or 50%  of the uk  who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is  wishful thinking   the report concludes.  the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly  those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more  the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive  the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access  it predicts.  the gap between  have-nets  and  have-nots  has been much talked about  but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark  the report suggests.  internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it   said adrian hosford  director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological.  there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits   said mr hosford.  as now  the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families  the older generation and the disabled.  those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots  the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025  the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem  said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment  online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs  explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome  he said.  if we don t address this problem now  it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs  education opportunities will be limited and they ll simply not be able to keep up with society   he said. the alliance for digital inclusion  an independent body with members drawn from government  industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.
golden rule boost for chancellor chancellor gordon brown has been given a £2.1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule  which allows him to borrow only for investment.  the extra leeway came after the office for national statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years. it comes just weeks ahead of the budget and an expected general election. shadow chancellor oliver letwin said:  at best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government.   a review by the ons found it had made a mistake by  double counting  some spending on roads since 1998/9. correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment  thus helping mr brown to meet his  golden rule  of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle. economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the budget.  the changes by the ons increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £2.1bn in total. mr letwin said:  this is a very murky area... there will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled.  the conservatives also said mr brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual £10.5bn  black hole  in the nation s coffers. but the treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.  in january the independent institute for fiscal studies (ifs) said mr brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year s budget. it also said the government might narrowly miss its  golden rule  if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06. after the ons announcement  economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about £400m.  none of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years   said jonathan loynes  chief uk economist at capital economics.  accordingly  it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course.

funding cut hits wales students the wales students rugby side has become a casualty of the welsh rugby union s reorganisation at youth level.  an amalgamated under-18 side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on thursday  against italy at the gnoll. but that move has seen the wru decide to end its funding of representative sides such as wales students. as a result  traditional international fixtures against england and france in the new year have been cancelled. the welsh students rugby football union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches. the secretary of the welsh students rugby football union  reverend eldon phillips  said:  it is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year.  the competition provided by the strong english and french teams has enabled the welsh students to test themselves in high quality matches.  the increasing number of young rugby players entering higher education look for the biggest challenge  that is representative rugby  but this year that opportunity will be denied them. players who have played for wales students before going on to win full senior representative honours include robert jones  rob howley  jon humphreys  darren morris  martyn williams and ceri sweeney.
brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time  tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other.  this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government s global aid and debt initiatives  particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. it dominated the prime minister s monthly news conference  which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. as he told journalists:  i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. there is a complete unity of purpose.  and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job  and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election.  so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown s long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt  he was asked  by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. well  not really  as it happens.  and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were  before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers  preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. although in the next breath he declared:  i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers  before catching himself on and quickly adding:  in so far as i read them of course.  he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.  as far as the timing of the prime minister s press conference is concerned  there are two options. the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence  which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous downing street grid - to avert just such allegations.  either way  the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. firstly  the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government s response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt.  then  as if to pour fuel on the flames  both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw  aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott - without mentioning the other. all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had  as a result  started to set out his own platform. the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed  should  be in the manifesto  has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister s  turf  - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. the prime minister denied all that as well  repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that  unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry  it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.
van nistelrooy set to return manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy may make his comeback after an achilles tendon injury in the fa cup fifth round tie at everton on saturday.  he has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted a return in the champions league tie with ac milan on 23 february. but manchester united manager sir alex ferguson hinted he may be back early. he said:  there is a chance he could be involved at everton but we ll just have to see how he comes through training.  the 28-year-old has been training in holland and ferguson said:  ruud comes back on tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is.  the training he has been doing in holland has been perfect and i am very satisfied with it.  even without van nistelrooy  united made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at manchester city on sunday. but they will be boosted by the return of the dutch international  who is the club s top scorer this season with 12 goals. he has not played since aggravating the injury in the 3-0 win against west brom on 27 november. ferguson was unhappy with van nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury. united have also been hit by injuries to both alan smith and louis saha during van nistelrooy s absence  meaning wayne rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front. the teenager has responded with six goals in nine games  including the first goal against city on sunday.
new browser wins over net surfers the proportion of surfers using microsoft s internet explorer (ie) has dropped to below 90%  say web analysts.  net traffic monitor  onestat.com  has reported that the open-source browser firefox 1.0  released on 9 november  seems to be drawing users away from ie. while ie s market share has dropped 5% since may to 88.9%  mozilla browsers - including firefox - have grown by 5%. firefox is made by the mozilla foundation which was set up by former browser maker netscape in 1998. although there have been other preview versions of firefox  version 1.0 was the first complete official program.  it seems that people are switching from microsoft s internet explorer to mozilla s new firefox browser   said niels brinkman  co-founder of amsterdam-based onestat.com.  mozilla browsers - including firefox 1.0 - now have 7.4% of the market share  the figures suggest. mozilla said that more than five million have downloaded the free software since its official release. supporters of the open-source software in the us managed to raise $250 000 (£133 000) to advertise the release of firefox 1.0 in the new york times  and support the mozilla foundation. there was a flurry of downloads on its first day of release.  the figures echo similar research from net analyst websidestory which suggested that ie had 92.9% of users in october compared to 95.5% in june. microsoft ie has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from netscape  and its share of users has always stayed at around the 95% mark. firefox is attractive to many because it is open-source. that means people are free to adapt the software s core code to create other innovative features  like add-ons or extensions to the program. fewer security holes have also been discovered so far in firefox than in ie. paul randle  microsoft windows client product manager  responded to the figures:  we certainly respect that some customers will choose alternative browsers and that choosing a browser is about more than a handful of features.  microsoft continues to make significant investments in ie  including service pack 2 with advanced security technologies  and continues to encourage a vibrant ecosystem of third party add-ons for internet explorer.  firefox wants to capture 10% of the market by the end of 2005. other browser software  like opera and apple s safari  are also challenging microsoft s grip on the browser market. opera is set to release its version 7.60 by the end of the year. onestat.com compiled the statistical measurements from two million net users in 100 countries.
van gogh festival film withdrawn murdered director theo van gogh s controversial film submission has been pulled from the rotterdam film festival because of security fears.  it was one of three of his works to be shown as part of a freedom of expression event in tribute to the late film-maker s life. the film is critical of the treatment of women under islam. its tv screening is thought to have led to his murder. the 10-day dutch festival begins on wednesday. submission was made with liberal somali-dutch politician ayaan hirsi ali and was due to be shown on 30 january. van gogh was shot and stabbed to death in november 2004 several months after receiving death threats following submission s first broadcast on dutch television. two of van gogh s other films will be shown as planned  including the theatrical world premiere of his last feature 06/05.  festival director sandra den hamer said:  the festival reflects what happens around us and within cinema itself.  the festival opens with the french film the 10th district court  moments of trials made by raymond depardon. the event sees 14 films competing to win three top tiger awards which aim to introduce promising new talent. new sections added to this year s festival include cinema of the future and cinema of the world  with special focus on russian and south-east asian productions. there is also an iraqi-german offering entitled underexposure  which looks at life in iraq after saddam hussein.
llewellyn plans wales retirement wales record cap holder gareth llewellyn will retire from test rugby at the end of the six nations.  the veteran lock  who is 36 at the end of february  told bbc wales scrum v that it is time for him to bring down the curtain on his 92-cap wales career. llewellyn is on a one-season deal with french club side narbonne  but said he may consider retiring from all rugby.  i don t know what i ll do next year  whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career   llewellyn said.  narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year  so i ve got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else  but ultimitely coaching is where i d like to end up.  i ve done all the coaching awards and everything you can do in that respect  so it s just hopefully getting a chance somewhere.  fellow locks robert sidoli and brent cockbain  who both scored tries in saturday s six nations win in italy  are wales coach mike ruddock s preferred starters in the second row.  with the resurgence of the dragons  ian gough and the adaptibility of lock-cum-flanker jon thomas on the bench  llewellyn has not yet made a match-day squad this six nations campaign. but the former neath and ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt.  if i do get on the field then brilliant  although the boys are doing really well and i m very pleased for them   llewellyn added.  we ve had some really tough years in wales and the players have been through a hell of a lot.  sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away  but a few of us dug in there and it s really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now.  i was going to retire at the end of the last six nations  i d even told some of the boys in the squad about it.  but mike (ruddock) asked me to carry on for another season  which i ve done  still part of the squad  still trying to help them out as much as i can.  llewellyn made his wales debut in 1989 against new zealand as a 20-year-old  having caught the selectors  eyes in the all blacks  tour match against neath. the 6ft 6in player has not looked back since  going on to break neil jenkins  wales cap record on 12 june 2004 in the 50-44 loss in argentina.   there s been lots of highs - winning the six nations in  94  beating england in  93  i ve been on some great tours and seen some fantastic countries   llewellyn said.  but i think the best thing of all for me was the time i spent with the players  i ve met some great guys in rugby and made some great friends.  it ll be a bit strange on international days having to find somewhere to watch wales play  but at least i might have time to get my golf handicap down!  llewellyn captained neath for seven seasons  while being an integral part of the neath-swansea ospreys regional side s first season. but with the ospreys building for the future  llewellyn was eventually forced to look to france for employment - digging in his heels during contract negotiations to insist he must be allowed to play for wales.
guantanamo pair s passport ban the government has written to two of the british men freed from guantanamo bay telling them they will not be allowed passports.  a letter sent to martin mubanga said his british passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the us. this suggested he was likely to take part in action against uk or allied targets if he left britain  it said. an identical letter has been sent to feroz abbasi  the men s solicitor says.  it is not known whether the other two men released from the cuba detention camp in january - richard belmar and moazzam begg - have also received letters. the government is implementing the rarely used royal prerogative in order to withdraw the men s passports. it is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976. the letter  from the home office  says:  i am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the united states  the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that  on leaving the united kingdom  you would take part in activities against the united kingdom  or allied targets.   the home office said it could not comment on individual cases.  the liberal democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the us in order for the men to be allowed home from guantanamo bay.  home affairs spokesman mark oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture. he added:  the power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and i find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time.  he said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the royal prerogative. the liberal democrats have promised to raise the issue in parliament.  amnesty international uk also questioned whether the decisions had been based on  torture evidence  obtained at guantanamo bay.  furthermore  we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the uk in the detention of uk residents and nationals and possibly many others at guantanamo bay   said director kate allen. the men s solicitor  louise christian  has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. but the pentagon told bbc news us policy  condemns and prohibits  torture and said there was no evidence that any british detainee was tortured or abused. mr abbasi  23  from croydon  south london  was taken to guantanamo bay after being captured in afghanistan in 2001. mr mubanga  29  from north london  was originally detained in zambia.
card fraudsters  targeting web  new safeguards on credit and debit card payments in shops has led fraudsters to focus on internet and phone payments  an anti-fraud agency has said.  anti-fraud consultancy retail decisions says  card-not-present  fraud  where goods are paid for online or by phone  has risen since the start of 2005. the introduction of  chip and pin  cards has tightened security for transactions on the high street. but the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack  retail decisions said.  the introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number  instead of a signature. retail decisions chief executive carl clump told the bbc that there was  no doubt  that chip and pin would  reduce card fraud in the card-present environment .  however  it is important to monitor what happens in the card-not-present environment as fraudsters will turn their attention to the internet  mail order  telephone order and interactive tv   he said.  we have seen a 22% uplift in card-not-present fraud here in the uk... since the start of the year.  fraud doesn t just disappear  it mutates to the next weakest link in the chain   he said.  retail decisions  survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system  but that banks  performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy  at best.  the main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need   said mr clump. nearly two thirds - 65% - of the 1 000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments. of these  83% were happy with the experience  though nearly a quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number. however  only 34% said they had received replacement cards with the necessary  chip  technology from all their card providers. furthermore  16% said that none of their cards had been replaced  while 30% said only some had. uk shoppers spent £5.3bn on plastic cards in 2003  the last full year for which figures are available from the association of payment clearing services (apacs). altogether  card scams on uk-issued cards totalled £402.4m in 2003. card-not-present fraud rose an annual 6% to £116.4m  making it the biggest category even then. within this  internet fraud totalled £43m  apacs  figures show.
no ads for passion oscar campaign producer mel gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote the passion of the christ to voters in next year s academy awards.  gibson and his icon productions partner bruce davey said they would not be campaigning in print  radio or tv for success at the oscars in february.  this film should be judged on its artistic merit  not who spends more money on advertising   davey said. but dvds will be sent to oscar voters  who will be invited to screenings. icon spent very little on advertising the film  which deals with the last hours of jesus christ s life  when it was released earlier this year - instead  it made the film available for special screenings at churches. it went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. over recent years  marketing films to the members of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. last year  the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. academy president frank pierson praised gibson s move for working to restore the oscars as a  celebration and appreciation of excellence   and resisting the  crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award .
sbc plans post-takeover job cuts us phone company sbc communications said it expects to cut around 12 800 jobs following its $16bn (£8.5bn) takeover of former parent at&t.  sbc said 5 125 positions would go as a result of network efficiencies. another 1 700 will go from its sales department  3 400 from business operations and 2 600 across legal  advertising and public relations. sbc currently employs 163 000 people while at&t employs 47 000. the takeover was announced on monday. the deal will be financed with $15bn of shares as well as a $1bn special dividend paid to at&t shareholders.  it effectively marks the end of at&t  which was founded in 1875 by telephone pioneer alexander graham bell and is one of the us s best-known companies. sbc and at&t said estimated cost savings of at least $2bn from 2008 were a main driver for the merger. at&t is a long-distance telecoms firm  while sbc is mainly focused on the local market in the western us. both also have data network businesses. the takeover is subject to approval by at&t s shareholders and regulators. the companies said they expected to complete the agreement during the first half of 2006.
tautou film tops cesar prize nods french film a very long engagement has received 12 nominations for france s cesar film awards  despite a recent ruling it was  not french enough .  the world war i romantic drama starring audrey tautou  was recently ruled  too american  by a paris court as it was partially backed by warner bros. but the cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete. the film  directed by jean-pierre jeunet  received best actress  picture and director nominations.  last november a court judged the film was too american to compete in french film festivals. two associations of french producers challenged jeunet s right to french government subsidies  because warner bros was a backer. the ruling meant the movie - which was filmed in france and used french actors and technicians - was not eligible to compete for french prizes. but alain terzian  president of cesar organisers  the academie des arts et techniques du cinema  said the changes in eligibility rules  which allow films  of french expression   were made three months prior to the court decision. other films in the best film category include police drama 36  quai des orfevres  arnaud desplechin s kings and queen  abdellatif kechiche s l esquive and france s number one film at the 2004 box-office the chorus.  best actors are daniel auteuil for 36  mathieu amalric for kings and queen  gerard jugnot for the chorus  philippe torreton for l equipier and benoit poelvoorde for podium. tautou will compete against maggie cheung   emmanuelle devos  yolande moreau and karin viard for best actress. michael moore s fahrenheit 9/11  the motorcycle diaries  lost in translation  eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and 21 grams are all vying in the best foreign film prize. the awards ceremony will be held on 26 february. this year  will smith  star of i  robot  independence day and men in black  will be given an honorary cesar  along with french singer/actor  jacques dutronc.
blair pledges unity to labour mps tony blair has sought to reassure labour backbenchers that nothing will stand in the way of the party s bid for a third term in power.  mr blair was speaking to mps amid fresh rumours of a rift with gordon brown. a new book says the prime minister went back on a pledge to mr brown to stand down before the next general election. the chancellor has said he is focused on winning the poll and is due to join election supremo alan milburn for a labour poster launch this week. mr blair told the parliamentary labour party (plp) on monday:  i know from everyone here  in cabinet and government  nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.  the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other and seemingly in good spirits at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour. a new book  brown s britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston  says mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004.  it has caused a new wave of concern among labour mps gearing up to defend their seats in an election  widely expected to be held in may  and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the plp meeting. health secretary john reid earlier warned that labour members would not easily forgive anybody fuelling damaging speculation. he told bbc news:  those who co-operate or inspire these books  in my view  have to know that  whatever the short-term political or personal advantage that they think they might secure  they always do it by damaging the record  the unity and the re-election chances of the labour party and the government.  mr blair on sunday dismissed claims of broken promises  saying:  i ve dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don t do deals over jobs like this - you don t.   in a separate bbc interview  mr brown said he and the prime minister would not be distracted by  gossip .  it s very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government   he said.  on monday  mr blair s spokesman said:  the prime minister is determined that he will get on with the business of government because he believes that what people want.  mr brown says he discussed the election campaign with mr blair on saturday and promised to play his part.  mr peston said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt . mr blair had decided in november 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters  trust because of the iraq war.  he had then changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him. mr brown allegedly said he could no longer believe anything mr blair told him. conservative co-chairman liam fox likened the two men to  self-obsessed schoolboys . liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said their personal ambition was  getting in the way of good government . ex-labour leader neil kinnock said mr blair and mr brown could only deal with the media frenzy by continuing to say they would not allow a row to damage labour or british interests. he told bbc radio five live that mr brown would never encourage any kind of insurrection or coup.
concern over rfid tags consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency id (rfid) tags in shops  a survey says.  more than half of 2 000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags  which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low. the survey of consumers in the uk  france  germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini. the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology. the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.  more than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. ard jan vetham  capgemini s principal consultant on rfid  said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology.  acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns.  with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers  the industry can reach this point.  he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. they are also in use as a passcard for the m6 toll in the midlands  in the uk. mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance. he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. at least once consumer group - consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering (caspian) - has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. all kinds of personal belongings  including clothes  could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners  it warned.
2d metal slug offers retro fun like some drill sergeant from the past  metal slug 3 is a wake-up call to today s gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings.  with its hand-animated sprites and 2d side-scrolling  this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. but a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. and yes  that includes halo 2. simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2d side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. it is also the toughest game you are likely to play  as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on.  players must battle soldiers  snowmen  zombies  giant crabs and aliens  not to mention the huge  screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels.  the shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers  instead  to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. tanks  jets and submarines can be commandeered  as well as cannon-toting camels  elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq. doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls  and while this is a tough nut to crack  it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go. and at a mere £20  metal slug 3 is as cheap as sliced  fried spuds  as the man says. of course  most of you will ignore this  lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation  metal slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates  eye.
ec calls truce in deficit battle the european commission (ec) has called a truce in its battle with france and germany over breaching deficit limits.  the move came after france and germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the eu cap in 2005 - for the first time in four years. but  the ec did warn the two were under close scrutiny and it would act if their fiscal situations deteriorated. under eu rules  member countries must keep their deficits below 3%. france and germany will breach that this year. it will be the third year in a row that the two countries have broken the european union s stability and growth pact rules.  the eurozone s two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in november 2003 when they persuaded fellow eu members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold.  the commission then took the pair to the european court of human justice - which ruled eu countries could not put the pact  in abeyance   and confirmed the ec s right to launch  excessive debt procedures . after announcing its decision to erase france and germany from its list of deficit rule breakers  the eu said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget s below 3%.  the commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by 2005   it said in a statement. the eu expects the german deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of gdp next year from 3.9% this year  while france s is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year. the forecasts are based on ec predictions of gdp growth of 1.5% in germany next year and 2.2% in france.  berlin welcomed the decision  with finance minister hans eichel saying it showed that the ec recognised germany s fiscal policy was  on the right track even amid very difficult economic conditions . however paris was more subdued  with finance minister herve gaymard telling parliament:  we must continue along this path of saving money.  however  the move still had its critics  with the european people s party (epp) attacking the ec for backing down from punitive action.  the commission is buckling under the pressure from germany and france    epp spokesman alexander radwan said.  the scary fact is that budget sinners  despite having repeatedly exceeded the 3% deficit limit  do not have to fear any sanctions.  despite the commission delivering its decision on the two biggest eurozone economies  it refused to comment on similar action against greece which has also broken the 3% deficit ceiling. monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said that it was a matter for next week.
the future in your pocket if you are a geek or gadget fan  the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun.  the relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors  particularly among mobile phone firms  all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. to begin with  2005 will be the year that third-generation (3g) mobile phones become inescapable. the 3 network launched in 2003  vodafone launched its consumer service in november  orange followed in early december and t-mobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005. the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up.  already the extra capacity in 3g networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue.  show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them  and i ll write their obituary  said niel ransom  chief technology officer at alcatel.  instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3g phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. but 3g will not have everything its own way. it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax. this wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. kent is likely to be the site of the uk s first wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. analyst firm telecom view predicts that wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3g and will be a clear winner. bob larribeau  principal analyst at telecom view  said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of 3g networks. and the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. the technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers.  moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too.  for a start  bt looks set to roll out its bluephone project during the next 12 months. the service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip (voip). voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. anyone with a broadband connection  which is now more than 50% of the uk s net using population  can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused voip call services starting up. home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. if 2004 has been the year of the portable music player  they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. motorola has just announced a deal with apple to produce a phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. the pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. the only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. but that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with.
krispy kreme shares hit shares in krispy kreme doughnuts have taken a dunking on wall street after the firm revealed it would have to restate its 2004 financial reports.  the company warned the move would cut its profits by $3.8m to $4.9m (£2m to £2.6m) - or between 6.6% and 8.6%. krispy kreme said accounting errors had forced the move  adding that its board of directors made the decision to restate its accounts on 28 december. however  the company was unavailable to comment on why it had delayed the news.  it also warned it might have to further restate results for 2004 and 2005.  shares in krispy kreme sank 14.87% - or $1.83 - to close at $10.48 on the news. the revelation comes just a month after the firm warned earnings would be cut by as much as 7.6% as a result of accounting errors. krispy kreme said the latest adjustments involved the way it accounted for the repurchase of three franchise restaurants. it added it would now be reviewing how it accounts for its leases. in a further blow  the firm said it had been advised that some of its franchise owners were not in compliance with their loan agreements  and warned it might need to borrow extra money if it was required to honour agreements on franchisee debts or operating leases.  krispy kreme added that it had enough cash to fund its current operations  but it could not borrow any more under its existing agreements.  there are many more questions than answers  especially given increased concerns regarding company liquidity   jp morgan securities analyst john ivankoe said in a research note on the firm. the announcement is the latest blow for the one-time darling of wall street  which has lost 80% of its stock value in just over a year. the firm is currently facing securities and exchange commission investigation of its accounts. shareholders have also launched lawsuits against the group  claiming it made false statements and inflated sales.
india power shares jump on debut shares in india s largest power producer  national thermal power corp (ntpc) have risen 13% on their stock market debut.  the government s partial sell-off of ntpc is part of a controversial programme to privatise state-run firms. the 865 million share offer  a mix of new shares and sales by the government  raised 54bn rupees($1.2bn). it was india s second $1bn stock debut in three months  coming after the flotation by software firm tata. the share offer was eleven times oversubscribed.  it is a good investment bet   said suhas naik  an investment analyst from ing mutual fund.  power needs in india are set to rise and ntpc will benefit from that.  analysts say the success of the ntpc flotation would encourage the government to reduce stakes in more power companies. ntpc has said it will use the money from the share sale to feed the growing needs of the country s energy-starved economy. the firm is the largest utility company in india  and the sixth largest power producer in the world.
three djs replace peel radio show the late john peel s bbc radio 1 show is to be succeeded in february by three shows hosted by three djs focusing on diverse  non-commercial music.  huw stephens  ras kwame and rob da bank will each host the mid-week  late-night timeslot  showcasing uk talent. radio 1 said the show would not try to replace peel  but would rise to the  challenge  of  keeping his legacy alive  with unpredictable music. peel died after suffering a heart attack in peru in october. radio 1 said the three djs had been chosen for their  in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres . rob da bank has been hosting the john peel show since the dj s death. he is also one of the hosts of the blue room  an early morning weekend show that plays a mix of old and new electronic and dance music. huw stephens is currently one half of the radio 1 thursday night show bethan and huw in wales  which explores new music  especially up and coming acts breaking through in wales. and ras kwame is the host of 100% homegrown on radio 1 s digital station 1xtra. his show is dedicated to showcasing the best of uk black music and broadcasts live sessions  often giving new artists their first chance to perform on live national radio.  all of the three djs will continue to host their current shows on radio 1.  it is widely accepted that john peel can never be replaced   said the radio station. it added that one music would support both signed and unsigned talent  and said:  it will seek out those making music for music s sake rather than for commercial success.  above all it will provide support to emerging genres of music and styles that have not yet and may never reach the mainstream.   one music is not new to radio 1 as it already exists as a website  offering advice on aspects of the music industry  such as recording a demo and signing a record contract. radio 1 s controller  andy parfitt  said:  we believe that by having a series of djs hosting a selection of shows under the one music title  we will ensure that his legacy lives on.  stephens said he grew up  listening to john  and that it was a  massive honour  to continue peel s work championing new music. the show will be broadcast from 1 february on tuesdays  wednesdays and thursdays from 2300 gmt - 0100 gmt.
blogs take on the mainstream web logs or blogs are everywhere  with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.  these online diaries come in many shapes and styles  ranging from people willing to sharing their views  pictures and links  to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events  often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. most blogs may have only a small readership  but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. the most well-known examples include iraqi salam pax s accounts of the us-led war  former iranian vice-president mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic s government  and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign. there are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs  like wikinews.com  launched last november.  the blogging movement has been building up for many years.  andrew nachison  director of the media center  a us-based think-tank that studies media  technology and society  highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs.  you could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power  to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before   he says.  and blogs were a key part of that transformation.  among them were blogs carrying picture messages  saying  we are sorry  for george w bush s victory and the responses from his supporters. mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers  tv and radio.  we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases  mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas   he told the bbc news website.  but they followed the story  they didn t lead it.   some parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor  raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.  others  like the french newspaper le monde  have applied a different strategy  offering blogs as part of its content.  i don t think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. it is in transition  as society itself is in transition   says mr nachison. however  he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky  that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper.  the one-to-many road of traditional journalism  yes  it is threatened. and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse   says mr nachison.  the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what s acceptable for public consumption and what isn t  that s gone forever.   with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets  like camera or video phones  we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.   it seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.  but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing  in a web already overloaded with information. blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence  the so-called blogosphere  has already exceeded five million  and is growing at exponential levels. tools such as google s blogger  movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog. us research think-tank pew internet & american life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds  although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. but experts agree that the phenomenon  allowing individuals to publish  share ideas  exchange information  comment on current issues  post images or video on the web easily  is here to stay.  we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other   said mr nachison.  and there s going to be bad that comes with the good.
virus poses as christmas e-mail security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card.  the zafi.d virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. anti-virus firm sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus.  like many other windows viruses  zafi-d plunders microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. the attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces.  the virus  subject line says  merry christmas  and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. the message in the body of the e-mail reads:  happy holidays  and this too is translated. on infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus. the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america  italy  spain  bulgaria and hungary. the original zafi virus appeared in april this year.  we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already  and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards  and we recommend this to all our clients too   said mikko hypponen  who heads f-secure s anti-virus team.
berlin celebrates european cinema organisers say this year s berlin film festival  which opens on thursday with period epic man to man  will celebrate a revitalised european cinema.  of the 21 films in competition for the golden and silver bear awards  more than half are from europe with france particularly well represented. festival director dieter kosslick says this strong showing signals  a new consciousness for european films .  they re on an incredible winning streak   he told the reuters agency.  this isn t to say there aren t any good american films   he continued.  it s just that there are more good european films.   however  mr kosslick refused to accept that widespread opposition to the iraq war had turned audiences against hollywood imports.  there is no anti-american mood   he said. some 350 films will be screened at this year s festival  with a further 300 shown at the european film market that runs alongside it. more than a dozen celebrities are scheduled to attend  among them will smith  kevin spacey and keanu reeves. but mr kosslick says more would be coming had the academy awards not been brought forward to 27 february.  i m not worried that we won t be able to fill the red carpet with stars   he said  though he admitted the festival may be moved to january next year to avoid a similar clash. the 10-day berlinale runs until 20 february.
astrazeneca hit by drug failure shares in anglo-swedish drug have closed down 8% in uk trade after the failure of its iressa drug in a major clinical trial.  the lung cancer drug did not significantly prolong survival in patients with the disease. this setback for the group follows the rejection by the us in october of its anti-coagulant pill exanta. meanwhile  another of its major money spinners - cholesterol drug crestor - is facing mounting safety concerns.  this would be two of the three blockbuster drugs that were meant to power the company forward failing... and we ve got risks on crestor   said nick turner  analyst at brokers jefferies.  astrazeneca had hoped to pitch its iressa drug against rival medicine tarceva. but iressa proved no better than a placebo in extending lives in the trial involving 1 692 patients. tarceva - made by osi pharmaceuticals  genentech and roche - has already proved to be successful in helping prolong the life of lung cancer patients. aztrazeneca has now appointed a new executive director to the board. john patterson will be in charge of drug development. the company said mr patterson would make  substantial changes to the clinical organisation and its processes .  i am determined to improve our development and regulatory performance  restore confidence in the company and value to shareholders   said chief executive tom mckillop.
asian banks halt dollar s slide the dollar regained some lost ground against most major currencies on wednesday after south korea and japan denied they were planning a sell-off.  the dollar suffered its biggest one-day fall in four months on tuesday on fears that asian central banks were about to lower their reserves of dollars. japan is the biggest holder of dollar reserves in the world  with south korea the fourth largest. the dollar was buying 104.76 yen at 0950 gmt  0.5% stronger on the day. it also edged higher against both the euro and the pound  with one euro worth $1.3218  and one pound buying $1.9094. concerns over rising oil prices and the outlook for the dollar pushed down us stock markets on tuesday; the dow jones industrial average closed down 1.6%  while the nasdaq lost 1.3%.  the dollar s latest slide began after a south korean parliamentary report suggested the country  which has about $200bn in foreign reserves  had plans to boost holdings of currencies such as the australian and canadian dollar. on wednesday  however  south korea moved to steady the financial markets. it issued a statement that  the bank of korea will not change the portfolio of currencies in its reserves due to short term market factors . japan  too  steadied nerves. a senior japanese finance ministry official told reuters  we have no plans to change the composition of currency holdings in the foreign reserves  and we are not thinking about expanding our euro holdings . japan has $850bn in foreign exchange reserves. at the start of the year  the us currency  which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows  staged something of a recovery. analysts  however  pointed to the dollar s inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data  and highlighted the fact that many of the us s economic problems had not disappeared. the focus has been on the country s massive trade and budget deficits  and analysts have predicted more dollar weakness to come.
charity single for quake relief singers including sir cliff richard and boy george are recording a charity single to help raise funds for victims of the asian tsunami.  they hope the song will raise more than £2m for the relief fund. the song  titled grief never grows old and described as a melancholy ballad  was written by radio dj mike read. former boyzone singer ronan keating may also take part if a studio can be found close to where he is holidaying in switzerland. other music stars being approached include robin and barry gibb of the bee gees  jazz sensation jamie cullum  chris rea and olivia newton-john.  sir cliff has recorded his vocal part in barbados  while boy george has recorded his in new york. read wrote the song before the boxing day tragedy but had thought it was too gloomy to release. now he plans to have it recorded by a collection of pop stars under the name one world project.  it s a natural home for it because people kept saying to me   it s such a good song   but it s such a sad song   read said.  he said the song was a slow ballad and would work with around 10 singers  rather than a  sing-along  like the band aid 20 single raising money for famine relief in africa. the backing track has already been recorded and organisers hope it can be finished within the next week to get it into record shops as soon as possible. read went to the disasters emergency committee (dec)  which is co-ordinating the british relief effort  with the idea the day after boxing day.  i was totally shocked at the enormity and suddenness of the disaster and in tears on seeing the orphaned children wandering aimlessly in search of their parents   he said. read said all the funds raised by the record would go to the dec.  i d only be pleased in terms of what it meant for sales if it got to number one   he added. the charity welcomed the news of the single and said money raised would help its agencies working in the affected region to rebuild survivors  lives and livelihoods.
commons hunt protest charges eight protesters who stormed the house of commons chamber during a debate on the hunting bill have been charged with disorderly conduct.  the men were arrested in september after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted. those charged included otis ferry  the 22-year-old son of rock star bryan ferry and luke tomlinson  27  a close friend of princes william and harry. they were charged under section 5 of the public order act  police said.  five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside charing cross police station on monday evening  after the charges were formerly put to them. the men s solicitor matthew knight  said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.   there is no offence of trespassing in the house of commons - it is not a criminal offence   he said.  if parliament wanted to make entering the house of commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so  but it can t do so retrospectively.  we are not prosecuted for that. we are prosecuted for a public order act offence. we are not guilty of it.  they will appear at bow street magistrates  court on 21 december  a police spokesman said. otis ferry  a former eton pupil and joint leader of the south shropshire hunt  said:  i have no regrets.  we have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country.  one of the men  david redvers  34  from hartpury  gloucestershire  said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges.  the other protesters are john holliday  37  a huntsman from ledbury  herefordshire  robert thame  34  who plays polo with princes charles in team highgrove  auctioneer andrew elliot  42  from bromesberrow  near ledbury  point-to-point jockey richard wakeham  34  from york  and former royal chef nick wood  41. the 15 september protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in parliament square. four of the men ran out from behind the speaker s chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. the five tried to confront mps before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber.  speaker michael martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the house of commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. in november  the use of the parliament act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in england and wales. however  many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed  saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. last week  the countryside alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. the alliance said the 19 february meets would show the new law was  impossibly difficult to determine  and open to different interpretations.
microsoft gets the blogging bug software giant microsoft is taking the plunge into the world of blogging.  it is launching a test service to allow people to publish blogs  or online journals  called msn spaces. microsoft is trailing behind competitors like google and aol  which already offer services which make it easy for people to set up web journals. blogs  short for web logs  have become a popular way for people to talk about their lives and express opinions online.  msn spaces is free to anyone with a hotmail or msn messenger account. people will be able to choose a layout for the page  upload images and share photo albums and music playlists. the service will be supported by banner ads.  this is a simple tool for people to express themselves   said msn s blake irving. this is microsoft s first foray into blogging  which has taken off as a web phenomenon in the past year. competitors like google already offer free services through its blogger site  while aol provides its members with journals. accurate figures for the number of blogs in existence are hard to come by. according to blog analysis firm technorati  the so-called blogosphere  has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. it now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million  although some speculate that less than a quarter are regularly maintained.
tory expert denies defeatism the conservatives  campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned michael howard the party could not win the next general election.  the times on monday said australian lynton crosby told the party leader to focus on trying to increase the tories  commons presence by 25 to 30 seats. but mr crosby said in a statement:  i have never had any such conversation... and i do not hold that view.  mr howard later added there was not  one iota  of truth in the report. the strategist helped australia s pm  john howard  win four elections. mr howard appointed mr crosby as his elections chief last october. mr crosby s statement said:  the conservative party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and controlled immigration over the past week.  it added:  the labour party will be wanting to do all they can to distract attention away from the issues that really matter to people.

brown calls for £5.5bn aids fund gordon brown has called on rich nations to fund a £5.5bn ($10bn) plan to fight the aids epidemic and find a vaccine.  on the fourth day of his six-day tour of africa  the uk chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by 2012 if the world stepped up its funding pledges. doubling the £400m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives  mr brown said on thursday. he hopes to use the uk s g8 presidency to push the issue forward.   i believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat  cure and eradicate the world s deadliest disease of today - and today the world s least curable disease - hiv/aids - will rightly earn the title  the great generation    mr brown said in a speech during his african tour. the problems of hiv/aids were inseparable from poverty  he added.  at least $10 billion per annum (£5.5bn) is needed to address the hiv/aids crisis in low and middle income countries.  existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic.  the uk s proposal for an international finance facility is so important - increasing world aid flows by over $50 billion (£27bn). a doubling of world aid to halve world poverty.  mr brown also said he had agreed with the italian finance minister domenico siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease.  currently the private sector was only spending £60m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting  mr brown said. he called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first 300m vaccines at a cost of $20 each  thereby boosting the market for inoculations. this would be a  large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms   mr brown added.  more must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with hiv/aids and their families  he said. but aid charity actionaid criticised mr brown s preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on g8 nations to fund hiv/aids treatments. the charity s head of hiv/aids in britain  simon wright said:  while encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an hiv vaccine is important  a failure to provide any funding for hiv treatments condemns a generation of people to death.  hiv is decimating african countries  killing the most productive adults who should be working  caring for children and building the economy. an hiv vaccine is probably at least 10 years away. treatments are needed now.  on wednesday  mr brown visited slums in the kenyan capital nairobi . he will visit an hiv/aids orphanage in tanzania and a women s credit union in mozambique before chairing a meeting of the commission for africa in cape town. the chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a g8 aid package which he has likened to the marshall plan used by the united states to rebuild europe after world war two.
china suspends 26 power projects china has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations  including two at the three gorges dam  on environmental grounds.  the move is a surprising one because china is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. the state environmental protection agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river.  construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first  approval next   said sepa vice-director pan yue  in a statement on the agency s website.  some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits  but others would be cancelled  he said. altogether  the agency ordered 30 projects halted. other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in fujian. the bulk of the list was made up of new power plants  with some extensions to existing ones. the stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government s battle to control projects licensed by local officials. however  previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity  such as steel and cement. the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. in 2004  china increased its generating capacity by 12.6%  or 440 700 megawatts (mw). the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project  designed to produce 12 600 mw of electricity. it is being built on the jinshajiang - or  river of golden sand  as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. second and third on the agency s list were two power stations being built at the $22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4 200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant.  the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. it has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china. in april 2004  central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby nu river  which is part of a united nations world heritage site  the three parallel rivers site which covers the yangtze  mekong and nu (also known as the salween)  according to the uk-published china review. that move reportedly followed a protest from the thai government about the downstream impact of the dams  and a critical documentary made by chinese journalists. china s energy shortage influenced global prices for oil  coal and shipping last year.
peugeot deal boosts mitsubishi struggling japanese car maker mitsubishi motors has struck a deal to supply french car maker peugeot with 30 000 sports utility vehicles (suv).  the two firms signed a memorandum of understanding  and say they expect to seal a final agreement by spring 2005. the alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making mitsubishi  after several profit warnings and poor sales. the suvs will be built in japan using peugeot s diesel engines and sold mainly in the european market. falling sales have left mitsubishi motors with underused capacity  and the production deal with peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.  in january  mitsubishi motors issued its third profits warning in nine months  and cut its sales forecasts for the year to march 2005. its sales have slid 41% in the past year  catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. as a result  the japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; £2.77bn) in fresh financial backing  half of it from other companies in the mitsubishi group. us-german carmaker daimlerchrylser  a 30% shareholder in mitsubishi motors  decided in april 2004 not to pump in any more money. the deal with peugeot was celebrated by mitsubishi s newly-appointed chief executive takashi nishioka  who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm s troubles. mitsubishi motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to march 2005. last month  it signed a production agreement with japanese rival nissan motor to supply it with 36 000 small cars for sale in japan. it has been making cars for nissan since 2003.
piero gives rugby perspective bbc sport unveils its new analysis tool piero at the wales v england rugby union match on saturday. but what does it do and how does it work   picture the scene - wales are camped on the england line in the dying seconds of the six nations  opening match. a ball is flung out to winger shane williams who crosses to score the winning try for wales. but the england players are incensed - arguing that the pass was forward and the try should not stand. in the past  sports fans would be left debating the validity of the try for days and weeks to come. but bbc sport s new tool piero could end discussions in minutes.  piero  named after the italian painter and pioneer of perspective piero della francesco  creates a virtual stadium in which virtual players can be tracked from almost any angle. viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom  giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts. the technology has been created by bbc research and development for bbc broadcast and bbc outside broadcasts. bbc sport is the first client to start using the system.  in order to keep audiences growing and growing... we need to work closely with people who create technology and innovation to bring sport to life   said andrew thompson  the bbc s head of development  new media and sports news.  we want to appeal to core fans - to give them more analysis  more detail  more definitive answers about key passages of play.  piero works by taking telemetric data from fixed camera positions and sending that data inside the video signal to a pc which can then render the information into 3d graphics.  the more cameras using piero  the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into 3d models.  it allows us to tell the story of a passage of play  tracking individual players across the field  looking at tactics   said andy townsend  from bbc broadcast.  an operator can manipulate the information and provide almost real-time replays of incidents  as well as more in-depth analysis. the  virtual camera  can focus on virtually any aspect of the pitch  giving viewers an insight into action that the camera normally cannot see. piero also provides a wealth of statistical detail - from the length of kicks  to the length of a run of an individual player and the height of a lift at any lineout. mr townsend said sports performance companies were already showing an interest in the technology. bbc broadcast hopes the technology can be sold to third parties interested in using it a number of different ways - from sport broadcasting to entertainment and game shows.

man city 0-2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea s premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city.  wayne rooney met gary neville s cross to the near post with a low shot  which went in via a deflection off richard dunne  to put united ahead. seven minutes later  the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james  head and into his own net. steve mcmanaman wasted city s best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. in the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar. and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern. only shaun wright-phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony  looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems.  wes brown also found wright-phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline. wright-phillips  sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pin-point centre to the feet of mcmanaman. but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by side-footing the easy chance wide. john o shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him. he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much-needed pace into the united attack. rooney was being well marshalled by dunne - but that was all about to change. after the break  united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play. and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of city s best first-half chance  rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it - even if he needed the help of dunne s leg. worse was to come for dunne  who had been having a fine match. on 75 minutes  he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney s cross and united seemed home and dry. however  city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range. and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa. but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post.  - manchester city boss kevin keegan:  we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial.  we started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much.  but we still had four good chances  two after we d gone 2-0 down  the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from.    - manchester united boss sir alex ferguson:  it wasn t our best performance of the last three months but i think we re deserved winners.  at times  especially in the first half  we didn t play with enough speed. but with (cristiano) ronaldo and (ryan) giggs on  the speed improved.  derby games can be like that  they can be scrappy  dull  horrible and it was maybe like that.  man city: james  mills (bradley wright-phillips 83)  dunne  distin  thatcher  shaun wright-phillips  barton (macken 68)  sibierski  mcmanaman  musampa  fowler. subs not used: weaver  onuoha  flood. booked: fowler  sibierski. man utd: carroll  gary neville  ferdinand  brown  heinze  o shea (ronaldo 33)  keane  fortune  fletcher (giggs 64)  rooney  scholes (phil neville 84). subs not used: howard  bellion. booked: rooney  scholes  keane. goals: rooney 68  dunne 75 og. att: 47 111 ref: s bennett (kent).
elvis set to top uk singles chart rock  n  roll legend elvis is set to top the uk singles chart on sunday  27 years after his death.  the re-release of hit song jailhouse rock was out-selling x factor winner steve brockstein s cover of against all odds by 2 000 copies on tuesday. if the record does make the top spot  it will be elvis  19th uk number one. the last time he topped the charts was with the remix of the little-known song a little less conversation  which was number one in june 2002. if jailhouse rock does reach number one on sunday  it will be the 999th in the history of the uk pop charts. the song first topped the charts in 1958. chart analysts say elvis could score the 1000th number one as well. his record one night will be released the following week  followed the week after by a fool such as i  as part of his record company sonybmg s new elvis campaign. it has called it  the most ambitious singles release campaign in the history of the uk record industry .
thomas out of six nations wales captain gareth thomas has been ruled out of the rest of the six nations with a broken thumb.  the full-back will have surgery on monday after fracturing his thumb in the 24-18 win over france on saturday. but welsh legend phil bennett insisted wales can cope without thomas as they chase a first grand slam in 27 years. bennett told bbc sport:  such is the spirit in the camp  they ll put kevin morgan at 15  rhys williams at wing and just carry on.  thomas will miss the match against scotland on 13 march  and what promises to be a huge encounter against the irish six days later. bennett added:  it s a setback. he s a great captain  he leads from the front and the boys love him.  thomas was replaced at half-time by williams as his side turned around a 15-6 deficit in paris.   with gareth missing i would think michael owen will be our captain   said wales coach mike ruddock.  he did a great job in the second half in france. he has been vice-captain all along throughout the championship.  wales travel to edinburgh to take on scotland in a fortnight and then host ireland in cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the grand slam and championship decider. bennett  an inspirational fly-half for llanelli and wales in the 1970s  insisted the national team were entering a new golden period.  it was a great game and a magnificent result for wales   bennett told bbc radio five live s sportsweek programme.   the way this young team are blending  the glory days are on their way back.  we couldn t get possession early on and france dominated and scored two tries.  had they been ruthless  wales could have gone into the interval 30 points down. but they didn t take their chances.  wales defended fairly well but you cannot give that sort of quality ball to good sides.  the all blacks would have been ruthless and buried us in the first half. but the character we showed in the second half was quite outstanding.
profits slide at india s dr reddy profits at indian drugmaker dr reddy s fell 93% as research costs rose and sales flagged.  the firm said its profits were 40m rupees ($915 000; £486 000) for the three months to december on sales which fell 8% to 4.7bn rupees. dr reddy s has built its reputation on producing generic versions of big-name pharmaceutical products. but competition has intensified and the firm and the company is short on new product launches. the most recent was the annoucement in december 2000 that it had won exclusive marketing rights for a generic version of the famous anti-depressant prozac from its maker  eli lilly. it also lost a key court case in march 2004  banning it from selling a version of pfizer s popular hypertension drug norvasc in the us. research and development of new drugs is continuing apace  with r&d spending rising 37% to 705m rupees - a key cause of the decrease in profits alongside the fall in sales. patents on a number of well-known products are due to run out in the near future  representing an opportunity for dr reddy  whose shares are listed in new york  and other indian generics manufacturers.  sales in dr reddy s generics business fell 8.6% to 966m rupees. another staple of the the firm s business  the sale of ingredients for drugs  also performed poorly. sales were down more than 25% from the previous year to 1.4bn rupees in the face of strong competition both at home  and in the us and europe. dr reddy s indian competitors are gathering strength although they too face heavy competitive pressures.
no more concessions  on terror charles clarke says he has  no desire  to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book.  mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes - but labour s majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. lord strathclyde  tory leader in the lords  said ministers should expect it to be  substantially re-written .  the bill proposes  control orders   which as well as house arrest could impose curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against.  on monday  mps voted 272-219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke. the government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels. mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order  amounting to house arrest  would be imposed by judges and not politicians. lord strathclyde warned ministers that they should  prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill .  they should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and i think they should drop the most objectionable proposals  which are for house arrest.   but mr clarke told bbc radio 4 s today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords.  no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made  but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords   he said.   i have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the bill.  mr clarke s proposed amendment will be debated by the lords on tuesday without having been considered by mps. the debate is unlikely to result in a vote. speaking after the commons debate  shadow home secretary david davies said the bill had been  clearly very badly drawn-up  and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. he said it would be possible to  rescue  the government and make the law  tolerable  by amending it in the lords.  the scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous   he told bbc news.  mark oaten  for the liberal democrats  said monday night s vote showed the government had  lost the confidence of all sides of the house . he said:  they need to rethink the bill  and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders  build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects.  unless there is a major movement  this bill is doomed to fail.   bbc news political editor andrew marr said:  i think that this is a bill in deep trouble. it s been unravelling in the house of commons - it may unravel further.  the government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 march  when the current powers expire.
weak dollar hits reuters revenues at media group reuters slipped 11% during 2004  mainly due to the weakness of the dollar  the group said.  the company said it was optimistic about growth even as revenues slipped 11% from £3.24bn ($6.13bn) in 2003 to £2.89bn in 2004. reuters beat profit forecasts  posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to £198m from the £130m seen a year earlier. reuters also beat its savings target for 2004  delivering £234m of cuts. under its three-year fast forward turnaround plan it had aimed to save £220m during the 12 months to 31 december.  reuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to £160m from £610m a year earlier. the news and financial data seller said the year had begun well  adding it expected  further gradual improvement  in the second quarter of the year after good january sales. it added it was planning to deliver a further £105m of savings over the coming year - but said it expects to be hit with an £80m restructuring charge to pay for the cost of moving from fleet street to new headquarters in london at canary wharf.  improving customer relationships  more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005   chief executive tom glocer said  adding the company was beginning  to look beyond recovery to growth .
ministers deny care sums  wrong  ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under-estimated.  a report by the fraser of allander institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research. deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research. snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure.  the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the  care development group  of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings  according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university s fraser of allander institute.  dubious  assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another £130m by 2022  the report warned.  it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert. but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland:  we don t think we got our sums wrong.  obviously we will examine the findings of this new report  along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned.  we will look in great detail at any contribution to this  because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future.  and we are absolutely committed to doing that.   but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy. ms sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive s support for the policy  there were questions which needed to be answered and  if necessary  sums redone. she said:  serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the scottish executive.  we need to know that the money is there  not just for this year or next year  but into the future so that older people  and those who are looking forward to older age  can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met.
blair  said he would stand down  tony blair promised gordon brown he would stand down before the next election  a new book about the chancellor claims.  but the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the cabinet  according to the book. the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt  for each other. the book  brown s britain  said tony blair felt by november 2003 he had lost voters  trust.  the author s sources  all unnamed  allies  of mr blair and mr brown  said the prime minister felt the iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party.  the book  serialised in the sunday telegraph  alleges that mr blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy pm john prescott in november 2003 of his intention to stand down.  at that stage he saw gordon brown and said   look you are the next most influential member of the government  i need your help to get through the next year   mr peston said.  i myself recognise that i m going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and i will then stand down.   but he changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him  the book claims.  mr peston told bbc news:  my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were.  what the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust  mutual animosity.  i think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private i don t think the relationship is good because brown  understandably  feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.  there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently  following their separate responses to the asian tsunami. rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold mr blair s monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new  marshall plan  for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster.  former welfare minister frank field mp criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on gmtv s sunday programme.   what sort of model does it give to the nation when the two most important political leaders do nothing but fight it out together or use their aides to fight it out   the labour mp for birkenhead asked. he said the prime minister should sack mr brown  but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so. conservative policy co-ordinator david cameron  mp for witney  added:  if it wasn t so serious it would be funny.  but it is serious - you ve got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime  poverty or dirty hospitals - they are fighting each other.  carol walker  bbc news 24 political correspondent  added:  there is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign.  and clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster.
intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light.  scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade.   we ve overcome a fundamental limit   said dr mario paniccia  director of intel s photonics technology lab. writing in the journal nature  dr paniccia - and colleagues haisheng rong  richard jones  ansheng liu  oded cohen  dani hak and alexander fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. currently  says dr paniccia  telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials  such as gallium arsenide  used to make it.  telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved.  we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas   said dr paniccia. while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around  before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it  some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material.  it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light   he said. but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. even better  the laser light produced in this way can  with the help of easy-to-make filters  be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses.  it s a technical validation that it can work   he said.
elton plays paris charity concert sir elton john has performed at a special concert in paris to raise money for the victims of the asian tsunami.  the british singer played to a 2 700-strong audience on sunday at the french capital s bastille opera house. the concert was also part of an attempt to bring a broader range of events to the famous venue. money raised will go to the fondation pour l enfance (foundation for childhood) which aims to rebuild a children s shelter in sri lanka. sir elton played hits from his vast back catalogue to a sell-out crowd which included former french president valery giscard d estaing and his wife anne-aymone. the veteran pop star played piano accompaniment throughout the concert which lasted for three hours without an interval.  he told the crowd:  throughout the years  i ve done a lot of drugs and alcohol. it s true that i was a nightmare  impossible. for the last 14 years i ve been normal. now my drug is called david  - a reference to david furnish  his partner. the crowd  who greeted each song with a standing ovation  also included french singer charles aznavour and british ambassador sir john holmes. sir elton has also teamed up with phil collins to record a version of eric clapton s 1991 hit tears in heaven to raise money for the relief fund. a release date has yet to be set for the recording  which was organised by sharon osbourne.
prince crowned  top music earner  prince earned more than any other pop star in 2004  beating artists such madonna and elton john in us magazine rolling stone s annual list.  the singer banked $56.5m (£30.4m) from concerts  album and publishing sales with his musicology tour and album. he kept madonna in second place  as she earned $54.9m (£29.5m) while embarking on her global re-invention tour. veterans simon and garfunkel were in 10th place  their comeback tour helping them earn $24.9m (£13.4m) last year.   prince returned to centre stage after a decade in the commercial wilderness   the magazine reported. the singer s 2004 tour took $90.3m (£48.5m) in ticket sales and he sold 1.9 million copies of his latest album musicology.  although she grossed more than prince last year  madonna remained in second place because of the  monumental  production costs of her tour. heavy metal band metallica s madly in anger with the world tour helped push their 2004 earnings up to $43.1m (£23.1m). they were ahead of sir elton john  who took fourth place and almost $42.7m (£23m) from performances including a debut on the las vegas strip. other seasoned performers in the list included rod stewart  whose sold-out shows and third volume of the great american songbook covers album helped net him £35m (£19m). the highest-ranking rap act in the list was 50 cent  who at number 19 took $24m (£13m) to the bank.
us ahold suppliers face charges us prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping dutch retailer ahold inflate earnings by more than $800m (£428m).  the charges have been brought against individuals as well as companies  alleging they created false accounts. ahold hit the headlines in february 2003 after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its us subsidiary foodservice. three former ahold top executives last year agreed to settle fraud charges.  ahold has admitted that it fraudulently inflated promotional allowances at foodservice  improperly consolidated joint ventures and also committed other accounting errors and irregularities.  the nine now charged  who worked as suppliers to ahold  are accused of signing false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the retailer for promoting their products in its stores. food companies pay supermarkets and retailers for prime shelf space. the suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid  providing auditors with signed letters that allowed ahold to inflate its earnings. us attorney david kelley said he expects the nine vendors will plead guilty to the charges. he added that there may be more court actions in the future.  i don t want to leave you with the impression that these were the only ones involved   he said. among those facing charges are john nettle  a former employee of general mills; mark bailin of rymer international seafood; tim daly of michael foods and kenneth bowman  who worked as an independent contractor for total foods.  others include michael hannigan of sugar foods; peter marion of maritime seafood processors and first choice foods; gordon redgate of commodity manager and private label distribution; bruce robinson of basic american foods and michael rogers  formerly of tyson foods. pasquale d amuro of the fbi called the nine vendors the key ingredients in  the process of cooking the books  at ahold. at the time of the scandal  ahold was seen by many as europe s enron. ahold shares tumbled on the news and many market observers predicted that the fall out could damage investor confidence across europe. it was less severe than many had envisaged  however  and since then ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its reputation and investor confidence. ahold is the world s fourth-largest supermarket chain. its other us businesses include stop & shop  and giant food.
student  fee factor  played down a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland.  however  lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out. applications from england and wales rose by 17% between january 2005 and the previous year  up 23 600 to 27 700. fears had been expressed that a flood of  fee refugees  would try to avoid top-up fees of up to £3 000 a year being introduced in england. in june last year  mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by £2 000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood  although no figure has yet been agreed. legislation to introduce the top-up fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.  the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas. universities scotland  which represents university principals  claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out. director  david caldwell  said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities  but this was not a major factor. he told bbc radio scotland s good morning scotland programme:  the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality  they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.   they know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated.  however  it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here.  mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances  the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200.  also  the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales  where there are no plans for top-up fees  have also risen  by 19%. mr wallace said:  accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held  not just in britain.  we want to make sure that when students are making their choice  they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland.  we do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option.  very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.
iaaf awaits greek pair s response kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are yet to respond to doping charges from the international association of athletics federations (iaaf).  the greek pair were charged after missing a series of routine drugs tests in tel aviv  chicago and athens. they have until midnight on 16 december and an iaaf spokesman said:  we re sure their responses are on their way.  if they do not respond or their explanations are rejected  they will be provisionally banned from competition. they will then face a hearing in front of the greek federation  which will ultimately determine their fate. their former coach christos tzekos has also been charged with distributing banned substances. under iaaf rules  the athletes could receive a maximum one-year suspension. kenteris and thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the athens olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash.  no date for the trial has yet been set and again tzekos is also facing charges. the iaaf issued an official warning to the trio last year after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete  where they had said they would be. all athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times  so they can be available for out-of-competition drugs tests. but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago  when they decided to fly back to greece early. then just before the olympics  the pair dramatically missed another test in athens and withdrew from the games.
no uk apology  for colonial past the days of britain having to apologise for its colonial past are over  gordon brown has said.  the chancellor  speaking during a week-long tour of africa  said it was time to talk about enduring british values of liberty and tolerance. mr brown has signed a debt relief deal with tanzania which could cost the uk £1 billion. south african president thabo mbeki has attacked british imperialists  saying they treated africans like savages. mr brown said that missionairies had come to africa because of their sense of duty. he added that the history of internationalism and enterprise had given britain a greater global reach than any other country. bbc political correspondent mark mardell said britishness had long been a theme of the chancellor s but  never before has he been so outspoken in defending britain s past history .  the uk has pledged to pay 10% of the developing world s foreign debt bill in an attempt to fight poverty. on top of the relief deal with tanzania mr brown said the uk would make similar offers to 70 poorer nations around the world. under the plan - which could cost the uk £1bn - countries must spend the cash saved on health  education and welfare.  we make this offer unilaterally but we are now asking other countries to join us   the chancellor said. mr brown  on a week-long tour of africa  spent two days in tanzania before heading on friday evening to mozambique  a country where more than half of the 17-million population lives below the poverty line.  there he is expected to strike a similar debt relief pact. the chancellor said he hoped other g8 and european countries would follow suit. the uk has already cancelled its bilateral debts - money the uk alone is owed - with the world s poorest nations including tanzania. former international development secretary clare short questioned the effectiveness of debt relief as a means of tackling poverty.
classy henman makes winning start tim henman opened his 2005 campaign with a 6-1 7-5 victory over argentine david nalbandian at the kooyong classic exhibition tournament on wednesday.  the british number one will next play roger federer at the australian open warm-up event on friday. the world number one beat gaston gaudio 5-7 6-1 6-4  before andre agassi saw off chilean olympic gold medalist nicolas massu 6-1 7-6 (7-4). andy roddick beat ivan ljubicic  who replaced paradorn srichaphan  6-1 6-4. henman made an impressive start to the year  only faltering against nalbandian when serving for the match at 5-4. but the briton regained his composure to win the next two games for only his second win in six matches against the argentine.  it s a great start to the year - just what i was looking for   henman told his website.  over the years i ve found david very difficult to play against.   he returns serve very well and he s deceptively effective from the baseline  so sometimes it can be difficult to execute my gameplan well enough against him to get the right result.  beating somebody of his stature is always good for the confidence and it bodes well at the beginning of the year.  henman also revealed the extent of the back problems he suffered in the off-season.  i m not the most flexible and at the end of the year i was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where i didn t do anything   said henman.  when i started training again it really  really seized up. as much as i enjoyed the two weeks off i don t think it s so productive.  federer dropped a tight first set against 2004 french open champion gaudio  but was content with his game.  it was about getting used to the surface   he said.   the conditions are much quicker than doha  my timing was ok  but i could have served better.  all in all i m happy with the match  and i won it - that s a good sign. now i have a day off and hopefully play better the next match.  agassi was delighted with victory over massu in his first match for over two months.  i felt pretty good   said the american.  i liked the way the match played out and  maybe excluding a few second serve returns  i felt like i was doing most things pretty darn well for the first match.
clijsters set for february return tennis star kim clijsters will make her return from a career-threatening injury at the antwerp wta event in february.   kim had considered returning to action in paris on 7 february   a statement on her website said.  she s decided against this so that she does not risk the final phase of her recovery. if all goes well  kim will make her return on february 15.  the 21-year-old has not played since last october after aggravating a wrist injury at the belgian open. back then  a doctor treating the belgian feared that her career may be over  with the player having already endured an operation earlier in the season to cure her wrist problem.  i hope she comes back  but i m pessimistic   said bruno willems. clijsters was also due to marry fellow tennis star lleyton hewitt in february but the pair split  for private reasons  back in october.
deutsche attacks yukos case german investment bank deutsche bank has challenged the right of yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the us.  in a court filing on tuesday  it said the russian oil giant has few texas ties beyond bank accounts and a texas-based finance chief. deutsche bank claimed yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset. it had wanted to help fund gazprom s plans for a $10bn (£5.18bn) bid for yukos unit yuganskneftegas.  deutsche bank would have earned large fees from the deal  which could not be carried out because us chapter 11 bankruptcy rules made the kremlin s auction of yuganskneftegas on 19 december illegal under us law.  but the us bankruptcy court judge in texas granted yukos an injunction that barred gazprom and its lenders from taking part. yuganskneftegas will ultimately end up with gazprom. the winning bidder at the auction was a previously unknown firm  baikal finance group  which was snapped up days later by rosneft  a russian oil firm that is in the process of merging with gazprom. the effect of these transactions is to renationalise yuganskneftegas. deutsche bank contends yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 december auction of its top unit by the russian government  which was in a tax dispute with yukos.   this blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case   deutsche bank said in its court filing. mike lake  a spokesman for yukos  lawyers  said on tuesday that the company stands by its legal action. yukos is confident of its right to us bankruptcy protection  and  we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again   he said. yukos has said it intends to seek $20bn in damages from the buyer of yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through. in its filing  deutsche bank said houston was  a jurisdiction in which yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations.   it also said the us bankruptcy court should not become involved in  a tax dispute between the federation and one of its corporate citizens . it suggested the european court or an international arbitration tribunal were more appropriate jurisdictions for the legal fight between russia and yukos. the next hearing in the bankruptcy is expected on 6 january. analysts believe the tax dispute between the russian government and yukos is partly driven by russian president vladimir putin s hostility hostility to the political ambitions of ex-yukos boss mikhail khordokovsky. mr khodorkovsky is in jail  and on trial for fraud and tax evasion.
rap boss arrested over drug find rap mogul marion  suge  knight has been arrested for violating his parole after he was allegedly found with marijuana.  he was arrested in barstow  california  on saturday following an alleged traffic offence. he is expected to be transferred to a state prison while a decision is made on whether he should be released. mr knight  founder of death row records  served a 10-month jail term in 2004 for punching a man while on parole for an assault conviction. police said mr knight was stopped on saturday after performing an illegal u-turn and a search of his car allegedly found marijuana.  he is also accused of not having insurance. a 18-year-old woman in the car was arrested for providing false information and having a fake id card. she was later released. it was his second alleged violation  having previously served half of a nine-year sentence for breaking the terms of his parole. mr knight  39  was jailed in october 1996 following his involvement in a fight with a rival gang just hours before rapper tupac shakur was killed in a las vegas drive-by shooting. he was driving shakur s car at the time and was shot in the head. at the time he was on probation for assaulting two musicians. mr knight  a former bodyguard  set up death row records in the early 1990s with shakur and dr dre among his protegees. but the label has always been dogged by allegations it supports gang culture and fuels the east and west coast rap rivalry.
poll idols  face first hurdles vote for me - itv1 s pop idol style talent contest for would-be politicians - finally hits our screens this week.  over the next four days  hundreds of potential candidates will be whittled down by a panel of experts and public vote. the winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election  which is expected in the spring. but opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics.  any of them would make competent mps   former independent mp martin bell insisted on bbc radio 4 s today programme.  mr bell  who will be offering his advice to the contestants on wednesday  argues that westminster has its share of  odd balls  and the show will engage ordinary voters.  if it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that   he said. but sir bernard ingham  margaret thatcher s former press secretary  took a less charitable view  accusing the programme of  corrupting politics .  he said the producers would not achieve their aim of re-engaging voters  with that bunch of nutters . to give sir bernard his dues  monday evening s opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists. among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star  who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels. among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on bruce forsyth s birthday and bill oddie for prime minister. the show follows the time-honoured pop idol format  with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance.  the contestants were given 60 seconds to present their manifestos. then the final 25 were tested on their lobbying ability. they were then cross-examined by the panel  which was chaired by ex-itn political editor john sergeant  with television host lorraine kelly taking the nicki chapman role. but the real star of the show is kelvin mackenzie  in the simon cowell  mr nasty seat.  the former sun editor dispensed a stream of well-crafted insults and one-liners. his advice for one young contestant was to  get a haircut and a brain transplant . wheelchair user kevin donnellon was asked:  why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled    don t you care about the inuit    implored guitar-toting environmental campaigner barry lim.  i don t care about them. i care about myself and when the sun s shining i think - fantastic   replied mr mackenzie.  mr lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes.  when the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers mr brown  he says well  prime minister  bad news  all the houses in britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax   observed mr mackenzie.  that was an total disaster. i just couldn t seem to think of things to say   a crestfallen mr lim confided in the show s presenter  jonathan maitland. irfan hanif  a 25-year-old doctor from bolton  made a good impression  even if he was a little thrown by mr mackenzie s suggestion that instead of being treated by the nhs  young drunks should  given a good beating  and left to die. dominic carman - son of late libel lawyer george carman - was voted through to the final 25  on a platform of cutting defence spending to boost education. opinion was more divided over rodney hylton-potts  a 59-year-old convicted fraudster. mr mackenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress.  he could join the rest of the crooks in the houses of parliament.  but ms kelly said she  would not trust him as far as she could throw him . the series continues throughout the week  with the public given the chance to evict one prospective mp every night. itv will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner  but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates.
rescue hope for borussia dortmund shares in struggling german football club borussia dortmund slipped on monday despite the club agreeing a rescue plan with creditors on friday.  the club  which has posted record losses and racked up debts  said last week that it was in  a life-threatening profitability and financial situation . creditors agreed on friday to suspend interest payments until 2007. news of the deal had boosted shares in the club on friday  but the stock slipped back 7% during monday morning.  in addition to the interest-payment freeze  borussia dortmund also will get short-term loans to help pay salaries. it estimated that it needs almost 30m euros ($39m; £21m) until the end of june if it is to pay its bills. the football club is hoping that all its creditors will agree to defer rent payments on its westfalen stadium. borussia officials met with almost all the banks involved in its financing on friday and over the weekend. three creditors have yet to agree to the deal struck last week. on 14 march  one of these creditors - property investment fund molsiris which owns the club s stadium - holds its agm at which it will discuss the rescue plan. chief executive gerd niebaum stepped down last week and creditors have been pushing for a greater say in how the club is run. borussia dortmund also is facing calls to appoint executives from outside the club. the club posted a record loss of 68m euros in the 12 months through june. adding to its woes  borussia dortmund was beaten 5-0 by bayern munich on saturday.
xbox power cable  fire fear  microsoft has said it will replace more than 14 million power cables for its xbox consoles due to safety concerns.  the company said the move was a  preventative step  after reports of fire hazard problems with the cables. it affects xboxes made before 23 october 2003 for all regions but mainland europe - and consoles in that region made before 13 january 2004. microsoft said it had received 30 reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables. the firm said fewer than one in 10 000 consoles had experienced component failures. the recall affects almost three quarters of all xboxes sold around the world since its launch in 2001.  in a statement  it added:  in almost all instances  any damage caused by these failures was contained within the console itself or limited to the tip of the power cord at the back of the console.  but in seven cases  customers reported sustaining a minor burn to their hand. in 23 cases  customers reported smoke damage  or minor damage to a carpet or entertainment centre.  this is a preventative step we re choosing to take despite the rarity of these incidents   said robbie bach  senior vice president  microsoft home and entertainment division.  we regret the inconvenience  but believe offering consumers a free replacement cord is the responsible thing to do.  consumers can order a new cable from the xbox website or by telephoning 0800 028 9276 in the uk. microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order. it advised users to turn off their xboxes when not in use. a follow-up to xbox is expected to released at the end of this year or the beginning of 2006.
german jobless rate at new record more than 5.2 million germans were out of work in february  new figures show.  the figure of 5.216 million people  or 12.6% of the working-age population  is the highest jobless rate in europe s biggest economy since the 1930s. the news comes as the head of germany s panel of government economic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate. speaking on german tv  bert ruerup said the panel s earlier forecast of 1.4% was too optimistic and warned growth would be just 1% in 2005.  the german government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of joblessness with a range of labour market reforms. at their centre is the  hartz-iv  programme introduced in january to shake up welfare benefits and push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily subsidised. the latest unemployment figures look set to increase the pressure on the government. widely leaked to the german newspapers a day in advance  they produced screaming headlines criticising chancellor gerhard schroeder s social democrat-green party administration. mr schroeder had originally come into office promising to halve unemployment.  still  some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. the soaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology which pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500 000 in january. adjusted for seasonal changes  the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 million people or 11.7%  up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month. using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the international labour organisation (ilo)  germany had 3.97 million people out of work in january. and ilo-based figures also suggest that 14 000 new net jobs were created that month  taking the number of people employed to 38.9 million. the ilo defines an unemployed person as someone who in the previous four weeks had actively looked for work they could take up immediately.
u2 s desire to be number one u2  who have won three prestigious grammy awards for their hit vertigo  are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world.  the most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common. the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive  if not always groundbreaking. but such success is down to more than music. they have to be compelling performers  charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground. they also have to want it. they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it. the beatles had it  the rolling stones still have it  rem hold onto it and queen were it in a catsuit. and u2 have it in spades  and keep churning it out. their new album  how to dismantle an atomic bomb  comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and 17 years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the all-time rock a-list.  they may have lost some of the edginess and raw  youthful force that propelled them to the top  but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums.  vertigo  the first single from the new album  went straight into the uk singles chart at number one  knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit.  the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to   bono recently said. drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments:  we re very competitive - we want to be on the radio  have big singles. we don t want to be thought of as a veteran band.  the band have done  everything in their considerable powers  to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world  according to q magazine editor paul rees.   this makes them hugely determined and formidable.  he added:  they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up.  as such  they ve constantly re-invented and challenged themselves. they are  perhaps  alone as the only rock band that has got better with age.  the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised  mr rees said.  they do everything in the right way.  the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board  attracting fellow pupils paul hewson (bono  vocals)  adam clayton (bass)  david evans (the edge  guitar) and his brother dick.  dick evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on u2.  by 1978  they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager  paul mcguinness.  they were brilliant  but very coarse   mcguinness recently said.  in a way  they were doing exactly what they do now. only badly.  they struggled to attract record company attention  later being described as  pretty damn average  and  strange and eerie  by scouts who saw them live. they released two ireland-only singles  which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980  leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy. the stadium-filling  anthemic sound was u2 s aim from the start  and their third album  war  saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic  going to number one in the uk and 12 in the us. songs like sunday bloody sunday and new year s day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which bono rejected as a cliche.  his stage performances - which included flag-waving  speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation as an electric performer  and their appearance at 1985 s live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom.  in 1987  the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name  i still haven t found what i m looking for and with or without you. those songs took the band s epic  atmospheric sound to a simple  powerful and popular pinnacle. the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements. these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music  plus wildly extravagant stage shows  while still trying to retain their mass appeal. the achtung baby album in 1991 was followed by zooropa  pop and their corresponding stadium tours  which featured giant olives  flying cars  live phone calls to the white house and bono s transformation into alter-egos the fly and macphisto. he was also building a parallel reputation - not always to the pleasure of his bandmates - as a campaigner on issues from global debt to aids. before the release of how to dismantle an atomic bomb  they had sold 125 million albums around the world. but they still want more.
greek sprinters  won t run again  the careers of sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are over  says the boss of the organisation that cleared them of missing a drugs test.  greek athletics federation boss vassilli sevastis told the country s parliament:  i believe kenteris and thanou won t race again.  the damage to their commercial interests has been done   he added. athletics bosses are considering its reponse to the ruling  while the athletes face a trial in a greek court. greek prosecutors have brought spearate charges of missing the drugs test and faking a motorcycle accident. speaking to the greek parliament on tuesday  sevastis said that the evidence sent by the international olympic committee and athletics governing body the iaaf was not strong enough for the greek association to find the sprinters guilty.   we were given the task of getting the snake out if its hole but we were not given any evidence to do it with   he said.  so how can you as a greek with your hand on your heart try the athletes   he added. the athletes are technically free to compete while the iaaf reviews its response to the decision to clear kenteris and thanou. but sevastis said:  it does not matter if they are found guilty at the court of arbitration for sport and the current decision is reversed.
china had role in yukos split-up china lent russia $6bn (£3.2bn) to help the russian government renationalise the key yuganskneftegas unit of oil group yukos  it has been revealed.  the kremlin said on tuesday that the $6bn which russian state bank veb lent state-owned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks. the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with china. the deal sees rosneft receive $6bn in credits from china s cnpc.  according to russian newspaper vedomosti  these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk. reports said cnpc had been offered 20% of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos  yugansk s former owner  if cnpc had become a shareholder. rosneft and veb declined to comment.  the two companies [rosneft and cnpc] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries   said russian oil official sergei oganesyan.  there is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.   the announcements help to explain how rosneft  a medium-sized  indebted  and relatively unknown firm  was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk. yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.  the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. once the country s richest man  mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.  the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of china s desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. china s thirst for products such as crude oil  copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels.  clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage [in russia]   said dmitry lukashov  an analyst at brokerage aton.  they understand property rights in russia are not the most important rights  and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.   if the price of oil is fixed under the deal  which is unlikely  it could be very profitable for the chinese   mr lukashov continued.  and rosneft is in desperate need of cash  so it s a good deal for them too.
liberian economy starts to grow the liberian economy started to grow in 2004  but  sustained and deep reform efforts  are needed to ensure long term growth  the international monetary fund (imf) has said.  an imf mission made the comments in a report published following 10 days of talks with the transition government. the imf said that  according to data provided by the liberians  the country s gdp rose by 2% in 2004  after a 31% decline in 2003. liberia is recovering from a 14-year civil war that came to an end in 2003. the power-sharing national transition government of liberia will remain in place until elections on 11 october  the first presidential and parliamentary ballots since the conflict ended.  the imf said liberia s economy started to grow last year thanks to a  continued strong recovery in rubber production  domestic manufacturing and local services including post-conflict reconstruction . the imf however remains cautious about what it sees as a lack of transparency in government actions. in particular  it pointed to mystery surrounding the sale of iron ore stockpiles and the alleged disappearance of some import and export permits. these matters are now being investigated by the liberian authorities and the imf has called for their findings to be made public. the imf also said it was crucial that the central bank of liberia be strengthened  the national budget be effectively managed and a sound economic basis built to allow the country s large external debt to be addressed.  the imf team stands ready to assist the (liberian) authorities in strengthening the areas mentioned   said the report.  the team agreed with the (liberian) authorities that the period until elections and the inauguration of a new government will pose exceptional challenges to fiscal management  and expresses its willingness to provide...continued support.
blair ready to call election tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 may.  the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and  despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll  it has not shifted. over the weeks  there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term. and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour s stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust.  and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster - to underline that economic message. and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties  tax and spend policies.  during the phoney campaign  labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller  slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labour s plans was a cut. and it looked like the labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger  cuts .  he was sacked for his gaffe  but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track. a second central argument will be over taxation  with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again. mr brown slaps that aside  claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. as usual  the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum  the war on iraq  law and order and education  for example. but  as ever  it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. and  whatever that outcome  2005 is set to be a far more lively  even bitter campaign than 2001 s non-event.
rangers seal old firm win goals from gregory vignal and nacho novo gave rangers a scrappy victory at celtic park that moves them three points clear of the champions.  rangers had rarely threatened until celtic goalkeeper rab douglas let defender vignal s 25-yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net. opposite number ronald waterreus had been rangers  hero  saving superbly from craig bellamy and john hartson. striker novo secured victory  lobbing douglas with eight minutes remaining. it ended celtic s 11-game unbeaten run at home in old firm derbies and gave rangers manager alex mcleish his first victory at the home of his glasgow rivals. celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch  including twice already this season. they started confidently  with new signing bellamy  on loan from newcastle united  given his celtic debut up front with wales international colleague john hartson and chris sutton dropping into midfield. it took bellamy just four minutes to threaten  taking on marvin andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by waterreus at the second attempt. he had an even better chance after hartson dispossesed sotiris kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat. but waterreus did well to beat away bellamy s disappointing low drive from 16 yards. waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to hartson just inside the box and the dutch goalkeeper made a brave block. it was an old firm return for barry ferguson as mcleish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past hibernian. but rangers found celtic harder to break down and douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break. dado prso turned inside neil lennon only for the celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful 18-yard drive. a great defensive header by andrews prevented hartson pouncing from five yards out. hartson foxed vignal at the edge of the rangers box  but the striker s shot on the turn was again beaten away by waterreus. rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and vignal  collecting a knock back from fernando ricksen  broke the deadlock  douglas somehow letting the frenchman s dipping drive slip through his grasp. novo pounced on a moments  hesitation in the celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing douglas. ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin  but it could not prevent rangers  celebrations at the final whistle.  : douglas  mcnamara  balde  varga  laursen  petrov  lennon  sutton  thompson  bellamy  hartson.  subs: marshall  henchoz  juninho paulista  lambert  maloney  wallace  mcgeady.  : waterreus  hutton  kyrgiakos  andrews  ball  buffel  ferguson  ricksen  vignal  prso  novo.  subs: mcgregor  namouchi  burke  alex rae  malcolm  thompson  lovenkrands.  : m mccurry
mac mini heralds mini revolution the mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month. but does the latest macintosh justify the hype  let us get a few things dealt with at the outset - yes  the mac mini is really  really small  and yes  it is another piece of inspired apple design. there is more to be said on the computer s size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer. inside that small box there is a g4 processor  a cd/dvd player  a hard drive  some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system. a dvd burner  wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost. and if you do not have a monitor  keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also.  it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under £400 you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications - apple software. the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x  the operating system  as well as ilife 05  a suite of software which includes itunes  web browser safari  iphoto  garage band and idvd. i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with a better suite of programs than mac os x.  of course  users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs. for people who want to do interesting things with their music  photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer.  it s a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses   said mark sparrow  technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine. he added:  in essence  it s a laptop in a biscuit tin  minus the screen and the keyboard.  the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look a bit sick.  the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically-savvy to experiment with their macs. one user has already created a  dock  to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car.  the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for in-car entertainment - playing movies and music - as well as navigation. another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse. when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre - ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes  music  films and photos - partly due to its small  living room friendly design. but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case - at least not in the here and now the hard drive - at 80gb for the larger model - is too small to be realistically used as media centre.  while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than 80gb hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content. a media centre computer has to store music  files and photos and as such 80gb just seems too small. most pcs running windows media center have at least 120gb hard disks. coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card  a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is  not what it is not. but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses. so - is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing  graham barlow  editor of mac format  understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint.  it s just a mac  but we should be very excited - it s revolutionary in its size (smaller than pcs)  looks (looks better than pcs)  and the fact that it s the first mac designed to really go for the low-cost pc market.  the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland  bulky boxes. there are a number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on mini-itx motherboards. but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the home-build enthusiast or expensive pre-built options based around microsoft s media center software. but for the value the mac mini offers  bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before  apple is to be congratulated. let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution - it is a mini revolution.
firefox browser takes on microsoft microsoft s internet explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited firefox 1.0 web browser  which has just been released.  few people get excited when some new software is released  especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour. fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available. the release of firefox 1.0 on 9 november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant s internet explorer browser.  firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in 1998. much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february. earlier incarnations  but which had the same core technology  were called phoenix and firebird. since then the software has been gaining praise and converts  not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsoft s internet explorer. rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability.  internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie. before july this year  according to websidestory  internet explorer was used by about 95% of web surfers. that figure had remained static for years. in july the ie using population dropped to 94.7% and by the end of october stood at 92.9%. the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the windows- using  net-browsing population. firefox is proving popular because  at the moment  it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsoft s program. for instance  firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. it blocks pop-ups  has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed.  one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras  or extensions  produced for it. the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. this has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar google toolbar to a homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. firefox  which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix  also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans. a campaign co-ordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the $50 000 needed for a full page advert in the new york times. the campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers. ten days in to the campaign 10 000 people had signed up and now about $250 000 has been raised. the ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late november/early december. the surplus cash will be used to help keep the mozilla foundation running. microsoft is facing a growing challenge to ie s hold on the web using population. from alternative browsers such as opera  safari  amaya and even netscape.
microsoft gets the blogging bug software giant microsoft is taking the plunge into the world of blogging.  it is launching a test service to allow people to publish blogs  or online journals  called msn spaces. microsoft is trailing behind competitors like google and aol  which already offer services which make it easy for people to set up web journals. blogs  short for web logs  have become a popular way for people to talk about their lives and express opinions online.  msn spaces is free to anyone with a hotmail or msn messenger account. people will be able to choose a layout for the page  upload images and share photo albums and music playlists. the service will be supported by banner ads.  this is a simple tool for people to express themselves   said msn s blake irving. this is microsoft s first foray into blogging  which has taken off as a web phenomenon in the past year. competitors like google already offer free services through its blogger site  while aol provides its members with journals. accurate figures for the number of blogs in existence are hard to come by. according to blog analysis firm technorati  the so-called blogosphere  has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. it now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million  although some speculate that less than a quarter are regularly maintained.
guantanamo man  suing government  a british terror suspect held in guantanamo bay for 33 months plans to sue the government  it is reported.  martin mubanga claimed in the observer that an mi6 officer played a key role in consigning him to the us camp in cuba  following his arrest in zambia. mr mubanga  32  from wembley  london  said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp. the home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not  well informed . mr mubanga  who has dual british and zambian nationality  was one of four britons who were released from the us camp in january.  he said he was sent there after being interrogated by a british man who said he was from mi6  shortly after his arrest in zambia in march 2002. mr mubanga said he had been in afghanistan and pakistan to study islam. but he said he was unable to return to the uk because he had lost his british passport  and was travelling on his zambian passport instead. mr mubanga said the  mi6 agent  told him the passport had been found in a cave in afghanistan along with documents listing jewish groups in new york and suggested he had been on an al-qaeda reconnaissance mission. mr mubanga said the man  and an american female defence official  tried to recruit him as an agent  but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to guantanamo bay.  his lawyer louise christian said:   we are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to guantanamo.  and menzies campbell  the liberal democrats  foreign affairs spokesman  said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved mr mubanga s transfer to guantanamo. but a foreign office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of british intelligence or security agencies. and home secretary charles clarke told bbc one s breakfast with frost:  i m not organising a specific investigation into it.  mr mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview. he told the observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last march  only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years.  he claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box  naked except for boxer shorts. and he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot. mr mubanga  who insists he does not feel bitter  said:  i ve lost three years of my life  because i was a muslim. he added:  the authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me. they ve made me what i am - even if i m not quite sure yet who that person is.  the us government denied the claims  saying it condemned and prohibited torture. in a statement  it said:  the department of defense has no doubt that mr mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war.  he was detained to prevent him from fighting against the us and our allies in the war on terror.  but fair trials abroad director stephen jakobi said there were similarities between mr mubanga s account and those of other guantanamo detainees. he said:  the pattern is the same. the real problem is the concentration camp conditions in guantanamo.  is [charles clarke] really pretending this is all made up   mr mubanga and the three other freed british detainees were released without charge by uk police on their return from cuba.
winn-dixie files for bankruptcy us supermarket group winn-dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by wal-mart.  winn-dixie  once among the most profitable of us grocers  said chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure. it said its 920 stores would remain open  but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites. the jacksonville  florida-based firm has total debts of $1.87bn (£980m). in its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as us foods giant kraft foods  which it owes $15.1m.  analysts say winn-dixie had not kept up with consumers  demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. a 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure  and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month  winn-dixie s slide into bankruptcy was widely expected. the company s new chief executive peter lynch said winn-dixie would use the chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around.  this includes achieving significant cost reductions  improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores   he said. yet evan mann  a senior bond analyst at gimme credit  said mr lynch s job would not be easy  as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers.  the real big issue is what s going to happen over the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all their customers see this in their local newspapers   he said.

venezuela identifies  idle  farms venezuelan authorities have identified more than 500 farms  including 56 large estates  as idle as it continues with its controversial land reform policy.  under a 2001 land law  the government can tax or seize unused farm sites. a further 40 000 farms are yet to be inspected  the state s national land institute has told associated press. vice president jose vicente rangel has said farmers and ranchers with their titles in order and their lands productive have  nothing to fear.  critics of the land reform policy claim president hugo chavez is trying to enforce a communist-style economic programme that ignores property rights and will damage the country. land owners claim the national land institute has made mistakes in classifying lands as public or private.  but the government - venezuela s largest land owner - say they are proceeding cautiously to prevent conflicts. in a statement  mr rangel said the land reform is not against the constitution  which permits private property  while stressing the efforts are to  vindicate social and economically  years of inequality in the country.  one property in conflict with the government is the el charcote cattle ranch  run by agroflora  a subsidiary of the uk food group vestey. agriculture minister arnoldo marquez told reuters news agency the site s documents  do not guarantee that this is a private land . administrators of the ranch  however  have complained that pro-chavez squatters have taken over 80% of the property in the last four years  and the uk government has asked venezuelan authorities to resolve the conflict.  you should ask the company when they are going to put their papers in order and hand over the land that is not theirs   said mr marquez.
halo fans  hope for sequel xbox video game halo 2 has been released in the us on 9 november  with a uk release two days later. why is the game among the most anticipated of all time   halo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have pre-ordered the sequel. a science fiction epic  halo centred the action on a human cyborg  controlled by the player  who had to save his crew from an alien horde after a crash landing on a strange and exotic world contained on the interior surface of a giant ring in space. remembrance of things past it was not - but as a slice of schlock science fiction inspired by works such as larry niven s ringworld and the film starship troopers  it fit the bill perfectly. halo stood out from a crowd of similar titles - it was graphically impressive  had tremendous audio  using dolby digital  a decent storyline  instant playability and impressive physics.  but what marked halo as a classic were the thousands of details which brought a feeling of polish and the enormously-high production values not usually associated with video gaming.  produced by bungie software  renowned for their innovation in gaming  it caused a stir among the gaming fraternity when the developer was bought by microsoft and became an xbox exclusive. claude errera  editor of fansite halo.bungie.org  said:  bungie got everything right. they were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to.  nothing distracts you when you were playing. there was nothing in halo that had not been done before but everything in there was as good as it could be.  he added:  graphically it was superior to everything else out there.   it also had a depth to it that made it stand out.  halo was unusually immersive  sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller. it also capitalised on the growing popularity of lan gaming in the pc world - for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together  allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time.  the game instantly cultivated an online following  which continues today with a score of halo fan websites following every aspect of the sequel  halo 2. errera spends three to fours hours a day of his own time maintaining the hugely popular website  which attracts 600 000 page views a day from halo fans eager for the latest news.  when the xbox launched on november 15 2001 in the us  halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers.  halo is the most important launch game for any console ever   wrote the influential edge magazine in its review  giving it a rare 10 out of 10 mark. the game had its critics and while it is not a one-off original as a game  it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since.  the first time i played it i just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun   said errera  remarking on the level of detail in the game.  the game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game.  it blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of halo   said errera  referring to a fan who had created a video of master chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world. video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the game s amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained a cult following. speculation about the sequel has seen every titbit analysed and poured over with all the intent of a forensic scientist examining a body. when early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essay-length articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line. errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high.  it does not feel like a game release any more. somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in microsoft s history.  we re all just hoping that bungie has got it right again.   halo 2 is out on 9 november in the us and 11 november in the uk

ebbers denies worldcom fraud former worldcom chief bernie ebbers has denied claims that he knew accountants were doctoring the books at the firm.  speaking in court  mr ebbers rejected allegations he pressured ex-chief financial officer scott sullivan to falsify company financial statements. mr sullivan  made accounting decisions   he told the federal court  saying his finance chief had  a keen command of the numbers . mr ebbers has denied charges of fraud and conspiracy. during his second day of questioning in the new york trial mr ebbers played down his working relationship with mr sullivan and denied he frequently met him to discuss company business when questioned by the prosecution.   in a lot of weeks  we would speak ... three or four times   mr ebbers said  adding that conversations about finances were rarely one-on-one and were usually discussed by a  group of people  instead.  mr ebbers relationship to mr sullivan is key to the case surrounding financial corruption that led to the collapse of the firm in 2002 following the discovery of an $11bn accounting fraud. the prosecution s star witness is mr sullivan  one of six worldcom executives indicted in the case  he has pleaded guilty to fraud and appeared as a prosecution witness as part of an agreement with prosecutors. during his time on the witness stand mr sullivan repeatedly told jurors he met frequently with mr ebbers  told him about changes made to worldcom s accounts to hide costs and had warned him such practises were improper. however during the case on tuesday mr ebbers denied the allegations.  i wasn t advised by scott sullivan of anything ever being wrong   he told the court.  he s never told me he made an entry that wasn t right. if he had  we wouldn t be here today.  mr ebbers could face a jail sentence of up to 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. shareholders lost about $180bn in worldcom s collapse  20 000 workers lost their jobs and the company went bankrupt. the company emerged from bankruptcy last year and is now known as mci.

j&j agrees $25bn guidant deal pharmaceutical giant johnson & johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm guidant for $25.4bn (£13bn).  guidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers. analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting johnson & johnson s reliance on a slowing drug business. they also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs. a number of johnson & johnson s products are facing patent expirations  while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products. meanwhile  demand for defibrillators  which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected  is expected to increase  analysts said. the move by johnson & johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each guidant share  6% more than wednesday s closing price. analysts say that us antitrust regulators could force the firms to shed some overlapping stent operations. stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked.
bortolami predicts dour contest italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday s six nations contest against scotland will be a scrappy encounter.  with both sides looking for their first win of the championship  the third-round game at murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider. and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs.  it will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win   said the lock forward. italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in 2000  but two of those have come against scotland. this year  italy opened up with a stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing 28-17.  however  they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out. now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations.  scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh   said bortolami.  we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs.  as a nation  our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games.
uk firm faces venezuelan land row venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez s agrarian reform programme.  officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers. the government is cracking down on so-called latifundios  or large rural estates  which it says are lying idle. the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure.  the firm  whose agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in venezuela  insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law. prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted hato el charcote  a beef cattle ranch owned by agroflora. according to reuters  they plan to seize 12 900 acres (5 200 hectares) from the 32 000 acre (13 000 hectare) farm.  officials claim that agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. they also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production.  the legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus   state prosecutor alexis ortiz told reuters.  as a consequence the government has taken action.   controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th century.  critics say the powers - which president chavez argues are needed to help the country s poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. the vestey group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. but a spokesman added:  agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land.  the company pointed out that the farm  which employs 300 workers  provides meat solely for the venezuelan market.  last month  the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40 000. the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had  nothing to fear . under president chavez  the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state s involvement in the country s economy. it recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state.
newcastle line up babayaro newcastle manager graeme souness is closing in on signing chelsea defender celestine babayaro when the transfer window reopens.  souness is bidding to bolster his defence and  according to reports  contract negotiations are at an advanced stage with the player. babayaro has been in the premiership since 1997 when he moved to chelsea for £2.25m from anderlecht. but the 26-year-old has been surplus to requirements this season. souness would not be drawn on specifics over individual players.  but he said:  all i can tell you is that the chairman has worked really hard in the last couple of months to try to do deals.  we have said from day one we want to strengthen  and that is what we are hoping to do in the coming weeks.
ref stands by scotland decisions the referee from saturday s france v scotland six nations match has defended the officials  handling of the game after criticism by matt williams.  the scotland coach said his side were robbed of victory by poor decisions made by the officials. but nigel williams said:  i m satisfied the game was handled correctly.  meanwhile  matt williams will not be punished by the scottish rugby union for allegedly using bad language in his comments about the officials. he denies having done so. nonetheless  he was furious about several decisions that he felt denied his side a famous victory. but nigel williams told the scottish daily mail:  i spoke to matt williams at the post-match dinner.  he made no mention of the disallowed try or any other refereeing decisions whatsoever.  if matt has issues with the match officials  then he is very welcome to phone me and discuss them.  ultimately there is a match assessor at every international game to give an impartial and objective view of the performance of the officials.  that is the beginning and end of it.
us in eu tariff chaos trade row the us has asked the world trade organisation to investigate european union customs tariffs  which it says are inconsistent and hamper trade.  the eu s own institutions have noted the uneven way eu customs rules are applied but failed to act  the us trade representative s office said. small and mid-sized us firms were worst-hit  it added. the eu expanded from 15 to 25 member states in may. the us said it filed the complaint after talks failed to find a solution.  the move came in the same week that the us and eu stepped back from confrontation in a tense dispute over aircraft subsidies to european manufacturer airbus and us firm boeing. new eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said on tuesday that the two sides had agreed to reopen talks in the aircraft subsidies row  which led to tit-for-tat wto filings in last autumn.  explaining why it has asked the wto to set up a dispute settlement panel on customs barriers  the us trade representative s office said that it wants to tackle the issue  early in the eu s process of dealing with the problems of enlargement . ten countries  mostly in eastern europe  joined the eu in may. the us said its trade with the 25 eu member countries was worth $155.2bn (£82.8bn) in 2003.  although the eu is a customs union  there is no single eu customs administration   a statement issued on behalf of robert zoellick  us trade representative  said. lack of uniformity  coupled with lack of procedures for prompt eu-wide review can hinder us exports  especially for small to mid-sized businesses   an eu spokesman in washington dismissed the us complaint.  we think the us case is very weak. they haven t come up with any evidence that us companies are being harmed   said anthony gooch. it could take several months for the wto s dispute settlement panel to report its findings.
us bank  loses  customer details the bank of america has revealed it has lost computer tapes containing account details of more than one million customers who are us federal employees.  several members of the us senate are among those affected  who could now be vulnerable to identity theft. senate sources say the missing tapes may have been stolen from a plane by baggage handlers. the bank gave no details of how the records disappeared  but said they had probably not been misused. customers  accounts were being monitoring and account holders would be notified if any  unusual activity  was detected  bank officials said.  bank of america said the tapes went missing in december while being shipped to a back-up data centre.  we  with federal law authorities  have done a very robust  thorough investigation on this and neither we nor they would make the statement lightly that we believe those tapes to be lost   alexandra tower  a spokeswoman for the north carolina-based bank  told time magazine. but although there was no evidence of criminal activity  the bank said  the secret service - a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime - is said to be looking into the loss. new york senator charles schumer said he was told by the senate rules committee that the tapes were probably stolen from a commercial plane.  whether it is identity theft  terrorism  or other theft  in this new complicated world baggage handlers should have background checks and more care should be taken for who is hired for these increasingly sensitive positions   the democrat senator said. details of his vermont colleague pat leahy s credit card account are among those missing  senator leahy s spokeswoman tracy schmaler said. about 900 000 military and civilian staff at the defence department are among the 1.2 million affected  according to a pentagon spokesman.
white prepared for battle tough-scrummaging prop julian white is expecting a resurgent wales to give him a rough ride in england s six nations opener in cardiff on saturday.  the leicester tight-head is in the form of his life  making the england number three shirt his own. but he knows wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny.  the welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with   he told bbc sport.  they have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years.  white is also impressed with the welsh pack s strength in depth.  gethin jenkins is starting at loose-head for them. he has played a bit at tight-head but i think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good   he added. the 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the england and leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world.  he destroyed south africa s os du randt in the scrum at twickenham last autumn to give england the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory. leicester  who signed white from bristol when the west country side were relegated from the zurich premiership in the summer of 2003  have also been aided by white s presence this season. the tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the heineken cup.  i am pleased with my form   he said.  but my form is helped by the people i play with at leicester - people like martin johnson and graham rowntree.  it s been a good season so far and to be in the starting xv for the first game of the six nations is what every player wants.  i am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend.  white is now one of the more experienced members of the england squad which takes to the field on saturday. injuries have taken their toll and coach andy robinson has been deprived of richard hill  jonny wilkinson  martin corry  mike tindall  will greenwood and stuart abbott.  and with 27 caps and a world cup winner s medal to his name  white is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres matthew tait and jamie noon.  i don t know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way   he added.  when i first came into the squad  people like jason leonard and martin johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.   it gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you.  i was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good.  white missed the vast majority of last year s six nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going. and that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red-hot atmosphere in cardiff.  i enjoy the atmosphere. the millennium stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world   he said.  to go down there and hear the shouting and the singing - it s one of my favourite places to play.  this is probably the most even six nations for a long time. england  ireland  france and wales are all contenders.  on form  ireland should be favourites but you just don t know - that s the great thing about this tournament.
pupils to get anti-piracy lessons lessons on music piracy and copyright issues are to be taught to secondary school pupils in the uk.  the lessons  aimed at 11 to 14-year-olds  will introduce them to copyright - including the issues of downloading from the internet and the illegal copying of cds - and its role in protecting creativity.  music piracy  including illegally swapping music online  costs the uk music industry millions every year and has been blamed for a decline in world-wide cd sales. british music rights (bmr) - which was formed to represent the interests of songwriters and composers - worked with education experts to put together a learning pack.  songwriter guy chambers  who has worked with stars including robbie williams  has thrown his support behind the scheme. he said as well as educating children about music piracy  it would also protect young people planning a career in the music industry from  unscrupulous  individuals. at a debate in london to launch the scheme  chambers said:  i think it is important that young people receive practical and engaging learning in schools.  these lessons will give them an insight into how the creative industries work which will help them in possible future careers.  the education pack  which has already been requested by more than 1 600 secondary schools  is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry. it will also teach children about the importance of royalties and raises awareness of different careers in the music industry  particularly in the digital age.  henri yoxall  general manager of british music rights  told bbc news schools had been crying out for a resource to help them educate pupils about the issues. the scheme - which is an extension of bmr s respect the value of music campaign - is also being backed by singer-songwriters feargal sharkey  lucie silvas and grammy award-winning composer david arnold. silvas said:  i think it is so important that students gain an understanding of how the music industry works when they are at a young age.  i wish i had been given an opportunity like this when i was at school.  emma pike  director general of british music rights  said:  we believe that copyright is an essential part of teaching music in schools. it is vital that the creatives of the future know how to turn their ideas into value.  copyright education has always been important... creatives are facing more challenges and more opportunities from technological change.  technology is allowing people to create music and distribute their music to the public in a whole host of new ways.
uk pioneers digital film network the world s first digital cinema network will be established in the uk over the next 18 months.  the uk film council has awarded a contract worth £11.5m to arts alliance digital cinema (aadc)  who will set up the network of up to 250 screens. aadc will oversee the selection of cinemas across the uk which will use the digital equipment. high definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly british and specialist films. most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images. the new network will double the world s total of digital screens. cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server.  each film is about 100 gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte-size file. fiona deans  associate director of aadc  said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur.  the film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie.  people will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches.  the picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made - there is no degradation in quality over time.   the key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of british films  documentaries and foreign language films.   access to specialised film is currently restricted across the uk   said pete buckingham  head of distribution and exhibition at the uk film council.  although a genuine variety of films is available in central london and a few other metropolitan areas  the choice for many outside these areas remains limited  and the digital screen network will improve access for audiences across the uk   digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films  said ms deans.  it can cost up to £1 500 to make a copy of a print for specialist films.  in the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that.  distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer.  the uk digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors - which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048 * 1080 pixels. a separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in may. the sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs.  some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum - they don t need to be shown twice a day   explained ms deans.  a cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema.  with digital prints  every cinema will have its own copy.
domain system opens door to scams a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers  a trade body has warned.  the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.  registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers  says stephen dyer  director of ukif. domain names are the  real language  addresses of websites  rather than their internet protocol address  which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so  for example  website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian  a  look just like an english  a . but the computer code would be different  and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system  said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent  mr dyer said.  although the idn problem is well known in technical circles  the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked   said mr dyer.   it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site   he added. there are solutions. for instance  browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world s browsers. another solution  to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of  throwing out the baby with the bath water   he said. centr  the council of european national top level domain registries  agrees.  a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world   the organisation said in a statement.

mcilroy continues winning streak james mcilroy stormed to his second international victory in less than a week  claiming the men s 800m at the teag indoor meeting in erfurt.  the northern ireland runner set a new personal best of one minute  46.68 seconds - a time good enough to qualify for the european indoor championships.  i m qualified now and that s what matters most   said the 28-year-old. mcilroy is now hoping to gain a late entry into sunday s international indoor meeting in leipzig. the northern irishman is hoping manager ricky simms can swing it for him to compete after he initially withdrew after contracting a cold. after three successive wins over the past fortnight  mcilroy is brimming with confidence.  i ve been waiting over six years for this to happen and now i m certain my career has turned the corner.  on friday  mcilroy delivered an impressive run despite suffering from his bad cold. the aaa indoor and outdoor champion accelerated away from the field in the final 300m  beating german wolfram mulle by 0.90 seconds. mcilroy set a world-leading mark for 1 000m at the sparkassen cup in stuttgart last weekend. and his time in erfurt makes him third fastest over 800m in the world this year.
campbell returns to election team ex-downing street media chief alastair campbell will return to the fold to strengthen labour s general election campaign  the party has confirmed.  mr campbell has consistently made public his keenness to play a part in the poll  expected in may. both culture secretary tessa jowell and deputy prime minister john prescott have welcomed his return.  he is a strong labour party member   mr prescott told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme.  mr campbell quit number 10 in august 2003 after being tony blair s right-hand man at the 1997 and 2001 elections. labour have refused to discuss his exact new position and have not said how it would affect his downing street replacement david hill.  of course alastair s going to be part of the election campaign and i think that all of us who will also be part of the election campaign are very pleased about that   ms jowell told sky news.  but she said his return would not put anybody else s  nose out of joint .  this is the daft thing about the way in which politics is written about   ms jowell added.  there s room for everybody. we serve the country better if we make room for all the talent.  a labour source told the sunday times mr campbell would  effectively front  the election media campaign but said he would be given no formal title.  labour strategists told the paper he would be  set loose  on conservative leader michael howard in attacking his party s economic record when it was in power.  they used pictures from the 1970s in the 1992 campaign to remind people of the winter of discontent - and now it s our turn   the source told the paper.  making michael howard leader gives us an unmissable opportunity to remind people what it was like to pay mortgage rates of 15% even if it was more than a decade ago.  mr campbell was at the centre of the government s row with bbc over andrew gilligan s story about the iraq weapons dossier. the hutton inquiry cleared him of  sexing up  the dossier in the run-up to the iraq war. since leaving downing street  he has toured the country with his one man show  an audience with alastair campbell and presented a number of interview programmes for channel 4.
german bidder in talks with lse deutsche boerse bosses have held  constructive  professional and friendly  talks with the london stock exchange (lse)  its chief has said.  werner seifert met lse chief executive clara furse amid rumours the german group may raise its bid to £1.5bn ($2.9bn) from its initial £1.3bn offer. however  rival suitor euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle. ahead of talks with the lse on friday  the pan-european bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. the paris-based exchange  owner of liffe in london  is reported to be ready to raise £1.4bn to fund a bid.  the news came as deutsche boerse held its third meeting with the lse since its bid approach in december which was turned down by the london exchange for undervaluing the business. however  the lse did agree to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a  significantly-improved proposal  would be in the interests of lse s shareholders and customers. in the meantime  euronext  which combines the paris  amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges  also began talks with the lse. in a statement on thursday  euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash  but added that:  there can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.  a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in europe and the second biggest in the world after the new york stock exchange. however  neither side has made a formal offer for the lse  with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away.  deutsche boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by mr seifert with ms furse were plans to move the management of its cash and eurex derivatives market to london  as well as two members of its executive board. but  hans reckers  a board member of germany s central bank  the bundesbank  said that cash trading should also remain in frankfurt  something deutsche boerse could move to the uk.  it is not just the headquarters of the boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in frankfurt. this has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants   he said. local government officials in frankfurt s state of hessen have also spoken out against the move.  it is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain frankfurt s standing as the number one financial centre in continental europe   alois rhiel  its minister for economic affairs added.

junk e-mails on relentless rise spam traffic is up by 40%  putting the total amount of e-mail that is junk up to an astonishing 90%.  the figures  from e-mail management firm email systems  will alarm firms attempting to cope with the amount of spam in their in-boxes. while virus traffic has slowed down  denial of service attacks are on the increase according to the firm. virus mail accounts for just over 15% of all e-mail traffic analysis by the firm has found.  it is no longer just multi-nationals that are in danger of so-called denial of service attacks  in which websites are bombarded by requests for information and rendered inaccessible. email systems refers to a small uk-based engineering firm  which received a staggering 12 million e-mails in january. the type of spam currently being sent has subtlety altered in the last few months  according to email systems analysis. half of spam received since christmas has been health-related with gambling and porn also on the increase. scam mails  offering ways to make a quick buck  have declined by 40%.  january is clearly a month when consumers are less motivated to purchase financial products or put money into dubious financial opportunities   said neil hammerton  managing director of email systems.  spammers seem to have adapted their output to reflect this  focussing instead on medically motivated and pornographic offers  presumably intentionally intended to coincide with what is traditionally considered to be the bleakest month in the calendar   he said.

moore questions captaincy brian moore believes the england captain should not be a full-back.  jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament  in the absence of fly-half jonny wilkinson. the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson  a lock forward. and former england captain moore told the bbc:  full-backs are too far away from the action. that s not a reflection on robinson personally.  he added:  i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack - which is  after all  where games usually start and finish.  moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales  france and ireland in this year s tournament.  assertiveness in the pack isn t there  we re not getting enough people into the breakdowns   he explained.  wer e not getting quick ball  which means the backs are being stifled. their creativity depends on quick ball and we re not getting that.   with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson  coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance. and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further.  the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don t have the requisite experience   moore added.  you can t do anything about that but play them. there are players who have been knocking on the door  it s time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there s nothing on them.  we then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby.
iaaf will contest greek decision the international association of athletics federations will appeal against the acquittal of greek athletes kostas kenteris and katerina thanou.  the high-profile duo were cleared of doping offences by the greek athletics federation (segas) last month. now the iaaf will lodge an appeal with the court of arbitration for sport (cas) and has suspended both athletes. an iaaf statement said:  the doping review board concluded that the decision is erroneous.  the statement continued:  both athletes  cases will be refered to arbitration before the cas. the decision in both cases will be final and binding.   segas said the iaaf appeal was  expected  and  understandable.   now we are going to await the final result  which we cannot prejudge   said segas chairman vassilis sevastis. kenteris  who won olympic 200m gold at the 2000 olympics  and thanou were suspended by the iaaf last december after failing to take routine drugs tests before the athens games. however  the independent tribunal overturned those bans  clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in tel aviv  chicago and athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics.  kenteris  lawyer gregory ioannidis described the iaaf s decision as  not unexpected  but told bbc sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly.  the iaaf s timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions   said ioannidis.  the iaaf has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements  testimonies  the closing speeches of defence counsel... and nine audio tapes.   we have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth.  kenteris and thanou dramatically withdrew from last summer s olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august. the pair then spent four days in a hospital  claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. it was the international olympic committee who demanded the iaaf investigate the affair. thanou and kenteris still face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident
doors open at biggest gadget fair thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in las vegas for the annual consumer electronics show (ces).  the fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. about 50 000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. microsoft chief bill gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation xbox.  the thrust of this year s show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store  listen to  and watch what they want on devices any time  anywhere. about 120 000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging  storage technologies  thinner flat screen and high-definition tvs  wireless and portable technologies  gaming  and broadband technologies. the show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as intel  microsoft  and hewlett packard among others.  the story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them   jeff joseph  from the consumer electronics association (cea) told the bbc news website.  it is about personalisation - taking your mp3 player and creating your own playlist  taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.   consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004  according to figures released by ces organisers  the cea  on tuesday. the gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the us in 2004. shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. that trend is predicted to continue  according to cea analysts  with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. the fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank dvd media  liquid crystal display (lcd) tvs  digital video recorders (dvrs)  and portable music players.  this year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your pvr [personal video recorder] in your living room  you can move that content around the house.  some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere   said mr joseph. he said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the  democratisation  of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music  video  and images. there will also be more focus on the design of technologies  following the lead that apple s ipod made  with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.  the cea predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. gaming would continue to thrive  especially on mobile devices  and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. games consoles sales have been declining  but the launch of next generation consoles  such as microsoft s xbox and playstation  could buoy up sales. although it has been widely predicted that mr gates would be showcasing the new xbox  some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. some have suggested the announcement may take place at the games developers conference in the summer instead. with more than 52% of us homes expected to have home networks  the cea suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images  video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home  will be more commonplace. portable devices that combine mobile telephony  digital music and video players  will also be more popular in 2005. their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films  tv  and audio wherever they are. this means more storage technologies will be in demand  such as external hard drives  and flash memory like sd cards. ces runs officially from 6 to 9 january.
donor attacks blair-brown  feud  the reported feud between tony blair and gordon brown has prompted a labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds.  duncan bannatyne also attacked the government over iraq and its  poor  response to the asian tsunami crisis. his broadside came as ex-foreign secretary robin cook said he hoped mr brown would be premier at some point. mr bannatyne has previously given labour £50 000. he made his fortune from care homes and health clubs.  the 52-year-old on tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of cabinet disunity and international issues. his spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give labour more money  although he would remain a supporter and not fund the conservatives.  robert peston s new book has prompted more speculation about the blair-brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. mr bannatyne said:  disunity in the cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country.  gordon brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy  but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition.  the businessman  whose latest venture is a casino in newcastle  also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in iraq.  and he branded the uk government s response to the tsunami as  piecemeal and poor .  the people there need practical help not just pledges of money   he said.  the us has forces helping on the ground - we can do more.  british navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. mr bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on bbc2 business start-up programme dragon s den. but his spokesman insisted his attack on labour was not a publicity stunt.  in a separate development  robin cook gave his support to mr brown s prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be labour s election. but he insisted the recent squabbles between mr blair and mr brown were not  perceived as a problem by the voters   adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. mr cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was  not an alternative source of opposition to the government . he warned the  abstentions party  was the real challenge to labour - and they would not be motivated by mr blair s promise to produce an  unremittingly new labour  election manifesto. his comments come after dave prentis  the leader of britain s biggest union unison  told the daily record newspaper he wants a date to be set for mr blair to be replaced as labour leader.
at a glance: tory health checks the uk  opposition conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the general election. here s a guide to the plan:  people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. if they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb  they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. all people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.  tuberculosis  hepatitis b and hiv. a positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. all other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.  people would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the uk  or impose significant costs or demands on the nhs. they would also  if appropriate  have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.  people coming to britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care  childcare or teaching. children and pregnant women wanting to live in britain permanently would not have to have a chest x-ray for tb. under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and hiv.  the tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in britain because of poor health. however  they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.  they claim government figures show that tb in england has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. they also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. they say the plans will protect access to the nhs.  applicants will be tested in their home country. only asylum seekers will be tested in the uk once their refugee status is established.  home office minister des browne says the government already routinely checks people for tb if they come into the uk for six months or more from high-risk countries. recent medical checks were carried out on 175 000 people at heathrow airport and 10 000 at gatwick. from those tests  about 100 infectious cases of tb were found.  the tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. the party has looked at the way the system is operated in australia  canada and new zealand. the tory proposals are  quite closely modelled  on the new zealand system.  labour claims the policy is little more than a  desperate attempt to catch up with labour s five-year plan  for immigration and asylum  which was published last week. this says health screening for tb will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk. the liberal democrats have warned labour and the tories they were  in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it .
india unveils anti-poverty budget india is to boost spending on primary schools and health in a budget flagged as a boost for the ordinary citizen.  india s defence budget has also been raised 7.8% to 830bn rupees ($19bn). the priority for finance minister palaniappan chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government s communist allies onside. but his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit  which he said would be 4.5% of gdp in the year to march 2005. the country s overall deficit is thought to be more than 10%  if the spending of india s 35 states and territories is included. under the fiscal responsibility law  mr chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year  a target he says he has now met for the current year.  but the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3%  mr chidambaram said - falling short of the new law s requirement.  i was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act   he said. the following year  though  would have to be back on track  he warned.   i may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means   he said. the coming year s reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in india s burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system  although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget.  presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament  mr chidambaram said the indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in. he said india s economy grew 6.9% in 2004. in his budget mr chidambaram has:  - increased spending on primary education to 71.56bn rupees ($1.6bn)   - increased spending on health to 102.8bn rupees ($2.35bn)   - announced that 80bn rupees ($1.8bn) will be spent on building rural infrastructure   - pledged 102.16bn rupees ($2.3bn) for tsunami victims   - increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30%   - announced a package for the sugar industry  in addition  up to 100bn rupees ($2.3bn) to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country s foreign exchange reserves  keeping budgeted spending under control.  given the resilience of the indian economy... it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty   mr chidambaram said.  the whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty.  the new indian government  led by the congress party  was voted into power last may after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with a  human face .  the finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming india s tax system while expanding the tax base. as part of his reforms he has announced:  - duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials   - expanded service tax net   - raised the income-tax threshold to 100 000 rupees ($2 300)   - reduced income tax for those earning less than 250 000 rupees ($5 700) to 20%   - reduced corporate tax rates to 30%  an annual economic survey released on friday said india needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment  reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth. but mr chidambaram is under pressure from the communist parties to focus on increasing social spending. the communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will. in recent months  they have expressed their displeasure at the government s economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation. in his last budget  mr chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers.
wasps 31-37 leicester leicester withstood a stunning wasps comeback to win a pulsating heineken cup encounter at the causeway stadium.  the tigers stormed 22-6 ahead within 18 minutes through tries from lewis moody  geordan murphy and martin corry. european champions wasps fought back through a josh lewsey try and mark van gisbergen s boot  and they were level at 31-31 with five minutes remaining. but it was the visitors who kept their cool as andy goode kicked the tigers to victory with a penalty and a drop goal. the closing moments saw desperate defence from leicester as wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed. wasps pounded the line and a penalty try looked likely before referee nigel williams controversially blew for full-time. fly-half goode was the tigers hero  kicking 22 points in total  while leicester s overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told. even their lack of discipline in defence - which presented the admirable van ginsberg with 26 points - could not undo them as they held out for a famous win.  lawrence dallaglio s team have now got it all to do in the quest for a quarter-final place given that two of their last three games are away - against leicester and biarritz. however  wasps rugby director warren gatland warned his side will will not relinquish their european title without a fight.  if we lose next week  then we are struggling   said gatland.  but we don t want to give this trophy away. we worked so hard to win it last season  we will go down fighting.  we have got to get our scrum right next week  it is the biggest cause for concern.  leicester coach john wells saluted the outstanding work of graham rowntree and julian white  who were magnificent up front.  they were the backbone of our performance today   said wells.  and to score three tries against the european champions at home was also something i am pleased about.   van gisbergen; lewsey  erinle  abbott  voyce; king  dawson; dowd  greening  green; shaw  birkett; worsley  o connor  dallaglio (capt).  replacements: gotting  mckenzie  lock  hart  biljon  brooks  hoadley.  murphy; rabeni  smith  gibson  healey; goode  ellis; rowntree  chuter  white  m johnson (capt)  l deacon; moody  back  corry.  replacements (from): buckland/cockerill  morris  kay  w johnson/b deacon  h tuilagi  bemand  a tuiliagi  lloyd  vesty.
pop band busted to  take a break  chart-topping pop band busted have confirmed that they plan to  take a break   following rumours that they were on the verge of splitting.  a statement from the band s record company universal said frontman charlie simpson planned to spend some time working with his other band  fightstar. however they said that busted would  reconvene in due course . the band have had eight top three hits  including four number ones  since they first hit the charts in 2002. their singles include what i go to school for  year 3000  crashed the wedding  you said no  and who s david   the band  which also includes members matt jay and james bourne  made the top ten with their self-titled debut album  as well as the follow-up  a present for everyone  in 2003. they won best pop act and best breakthrough act at the 2004 brit awards and were nominated for best british group. most recently they topped the charts with the theme from the live-action film version of thunderbirds  which was voted record of the year on the itv1 show. the band have capitalised on a craze for artists playing catchy pop music with rock overtones. the trio are seen as an alternative to more manufactured artists who are not considered credible musicians because they do not write their own songs or play their own instruments. however  recent rumours have suggested that simpson has been wanting to quit the band to focus on fightstar. he now plans to take fightstar on tour.
orange colour clash set for court a row over the colour orange could hit the courts after mobile phone giant orange launched action against a new mobile venture from easyjet s founder.  orange said it was starting proceedings against the easymobile service for trademark infringement. easymobile uses easygroup s orange branding. founder stelios haji-ioannou has pledged to contest the action. the move comes after the two sides failed to come to an agreement after six months of talks. orange claims the new low-cost mobile service has infringed its rights regarding the use of the colour orange and could confuse customers - known as  passing off .   our brand  and the rights associated with it are extremely important to us   orange said in a statement.  in the absence of any firm commitment from easy  we have been left with no choice but to start an action for trademark infringement and passing off.  however  mr haji-ioannou  who plans to launch easymobile next month  vowed to fight back  saying:  we have nothing to be afraid of in this court case.  it is our right to use our own corporate colour for which we have become famous during the last 10 years.  the easyjet founder also said he planned to add a disclaimer to the easygroup website to ensure customers are aware the easymobile brand has no connection to orange. the new service is the latest venture from easygroup  which includes a chain of internet cafes  budget car rentals and an intercity bus service. easymobile will allow customers to go online to order sim cards and airtime - which will be rented from t-mobile - for their existing handsets.
tories attack burglar  u-turns  tory leader michael howard has accused tony blair of performing u-turns over rules on using force against burglars.  the government has ruled out amending the present law  which allows  reasonable force  in self defence. mr howard branded the decision unacceptable  saying:  it is not householders who should be frightened  it s the burglars.  home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.  metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using  grossly disproportionate  force could be prosecuted. the pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and crown prosecution service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. he told mps:  if we get the right response from those people  we will  of course  support a change in the law.  instead  the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. on thursday  mr howard told bbc radio 4 s today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change  then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. he said:  we ve had three policy positions in three months and two u-turns.  it s not surprising gordon brown told him:  there s nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe.    mr howard said the  grossly disproportionate  test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were  weighted overwhelmingly  in favour of the householder  said mr clarke. he said:  the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making.  the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue  added mr clarke. the director of public prosecutions  ken macdonald  says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar  tied him up  beat him and set him alight  he said. tory mp patrick mercer s private member s bill to change the law received a first reading in parliament on wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.
bond game fails to shake or stir for gaming fans  the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of 1995  but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left n64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour.  adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game  for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original s massive sense of fun. this however is not a sequel  nor does it relate to the goldeneye film. you are the eponymous renegade spy  an agent who deserts to the bond world s extensive ranks of criminal masterminds  after being deemed too brutal for mi6. your new commander-in-chief is the portly auric goldfinger  last seen in 1964  but happily running around bent on world domination. with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turner s similarly-titled theme song  the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury  which enables a degree of x-ray vision.  rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments  squashed by a plummeting helicopter. the notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game  but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to.  recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair  invention and glamour of the film franchise. this title lacks that aura  and when the bond magic shines through  it feels like a lucky accident. the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough. quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump  the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai  the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination. admittedly the competition has been tough  even in recent weeks  with the likes of halo 2 and half life 2 triumphing in virtually every department. what the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy  dynamic scenes of violent chaos. as is the trend of late  you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter. sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos  meaning that frustration is often the outcome. and irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed. a minute red dot passes for a crosshair  although the collision-detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for. shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky  and you will not always know you have picked them off  since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor  and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations. it is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker s allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights - no time is risked with a measured build-up.  by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no  goldfinger  hat-fiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years  and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion.  there is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains  and it is a testament to the power of the bond universe that they can cut such a dash. but the in-game niggles  combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought-through  will make this a disappointment for most. diehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings. the game is weak  not completely unplayable. then again  007 fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras. given james bond s healthy pedigree in past games  there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip  a commendable idea that just has not worked  that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return.  goldeneye: rogue agent is out now
blair and blunkett sheffield trip tony blair is to join home secretary david blunkett in a visit to sheffield on thursday.  mr blunkett s conduct is being looked at to establish whether he abused his position in relation to his ex-lover. the parliamentary standards watchdog is looking at his decision to give kimberly quinn free rail tickets. he is also being investigated over the visa application of mrs quinn s ex-nanny. the visit to sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by mr blair.  on wednesday during prime minister s questions  tory leader michael howard went on the offensive over comments mr blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography. he is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. mr howard said mr blunkett had complained he had inherited a  giant mess  when he took over at the home office from jack straw  now foreign secretary. the tory leader went on:  he doesn t stop there: he thinks the culture secretary s weak; he thinks the trade secretary doesn t think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasn t developed as expected.  he says the prime minister doesn t like being told the truth and the chancellor - no doubt the prime minister will agree with this - is a bully.  mr blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians.  the home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets  given to him as an mp  to mrs quinn and has since paid the £180 back. he has apologised for  a genuine mistake  and says he will write to the watchdog to answer further questions. the rail tickets are meant to help mps  spouses get between westminster and their constituencies. after his inquiry  parliamentary watchdog sir philip mawer will report to the commons standards and privileges committee  the group of mps who will recommend to the full house of commons what action - if any - should be taken against mr blunkett.  the separate inquiry by ex-senior civil servant sir alan budd is investigating whether the home secretary helped fast-track a bid by mrs quinn s nanny  leoncia casalme  to stay in the uk. last week  mr blunkett won the first round of a high court battle with mrs quinn for access to her son. mr blunkett declined to comment about his own position  saying the inquiry was under way and the high court had stressed his right to privacy did not affect his job in improving security and stability. downing street has stressed mr blair s support for the home secretary.
robinson answers critics england captain jason robinson has rubbished suggestions that the world champions are a team in decline.  england were beaten 11-9 by wales in their six nations opener in cardiff last week and face current champions france at twickenham on sunday. robinson said:  we are certainly not on the decline. you lose one game and it doesn t make you a bad team.  i have no doubt in the players we ve got. we have still got the team to go out and beat anyone on our day.  england find themselves striving to avoid a third successive championship defeat for the first time since 1987. but full-back robinson believes the new-look england team can stop the rot against france.   last weekend we should have won the game   he said.  but if we can under-perform and lose by only two points then i am sure if we play well this week we will get the win we need.  we proved that in the autumn - when we put in some excellent performances - and we just need to build on that.   it was a disappointing start against wales and we might be down on that.  but we are certainly not out. we will come out fighting this week.  robinson also had words of comfort for 18-year-old newcastle centre mathew tait  who made his international debut against wales but has been demoted from the squad to face france.   i have had a word with mathew   said robinson.  i still believe in him. he is an outstanding player but we have gone for olly (barkley) because of the kicking.  mathew has just got to take it on the chin  keep working hard like he is doing and i m sure he will feature in some of the games.
learning to love broadband we are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life  at least for some  argues technology analyst bill thompson.  one of the nice things about being a writer is that i rarely have to go to an office to work. i can sit in a caf&#233; or a library  with or without a wi-fi connection  and research and write articles. if i am passing through kings cross station on my way to a meeting then i can log on from the platform. and i can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne  a children s writer  at her house in cambridge  sharing her wireless network. but just over a week ago i arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection.  we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power  and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again. she called her service provider  and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem. this did not seem too bad  but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday. with no modem installed in her computer  she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial-up connection on her daughter s laptop  so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection. as a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial-up.  she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively. but the impact spread into her personal life too. she did not take her children to the cinema during half-term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas. she planned a trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website. and she did not know where to go fossil-hunting on the trip because she could not type  fossils norfolk  into google. of course  she readily admits  she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper  listened to the radio or found a book on fossils. but she did not  because having fast  always on  and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life  and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things. she may be unusual  but i do not think anne is alone.  according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april 2004  and numbers are climbing fast. there will certainly be five million by the end of the year. dial-up users are switching to broadband. my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start. more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections  and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason.  it is part of the process of adaptation  and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere. people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it  and show off the cool stuff they can do. they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity. of course  broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world. in south korea  japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits  or millions of bits  a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with. but speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband  and when it comes to checking websites for film times  looking at weather forecasts  or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives  even uk speeds are sufficient. it may not be the brave new world of streaming full-screen video and superfast file downloads  but it will do for now. and it is certainly better than slow access or no access. just ask anne.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.
kennedy calls for iraq exit plans tony blair should set out a proper exit strategy from iraq in the wake of next sunday s elections in the country  lib dem leader charles kennedy has said.  in a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of george w bush  mr kennedy said iraq had become a  crucible of militant terrorism . he wants to see a phased withdrawal of uk troops  as soon as the situation allows   he said in london. any exit strategy must  augment and support  the democratic process.   there are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of british and american troops in iraq feeds the insurgency   he said.  there is some truth in that  especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like fallujah  and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces.  mr kennedy pointed out that the netherlands  portugal and the czech republic  which all have troops operating in the southern sector of iraq  have announced their imminent withdrawal  regardless of the situation on the ground .  he accused mr blair s government of  being less than straightforward  over its plans.  next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in iraq   mr kennedy said during his city of london speech.  he should set out a proper exit strategy  including the phased withdrawal of british troops  as the security situation allows.  mr kennedy also argued that british troops deployed in iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries -  especially islamic countries .
